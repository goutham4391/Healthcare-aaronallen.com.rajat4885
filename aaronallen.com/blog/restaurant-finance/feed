				<p><strong>Every restaurant bleeds — it’s simply a question of where and how much.</strong></p><p>Just as banks and governments occasionally conduct stress tests to model scenarios and validate the stability of their systems under pressure, restaurant chains (and their investors) should endeavor to objectively pressure test their P&amp;L — with increasing rigor and frequency.</p><p>By performing a gap analysis and applying industrial engineering practices across functional areas, it’s possible to uncover areas of opportunity and quantify where value is trapped or hidden in a business. We look at major cost drivers (historically, current-state, and future-state) to determine how those can be made more efficient. While the aim is to improve profitability and ensure a business is as productive as possible, it’s also about being confident in the blend of what the concept, brand, and consumer needs.</p><h2>In Other Words: Be Your Own Activist Before Someone Else Is</h2><p>Many chains have already done their level best in managing the business through challenges and pressures on their P&amp;L (and their private equity investors have already harvested the low-hanging fruit identified in pre-investment <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210306164104/https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-due-diligence">due diligence</a>).</p><p>But once the obvious cost-cutting and trimming of the fat has been rendered, the margin yield is often still not enough to prop-up same-store sales declines (in fact, in many cases, the well-intentioned efforts have compromised the experience for customers and crews in a way that feels akin to chipping bone; and comparable sales declines are trending downward on a much steeper slope than traffic counts are climbing).</p><p>We recommend a holistic approach be applied to looking at the organization, working across functional areas and down individual line items of the restaurant P&amp;L while reviewing factors impacting performance both inside and outside the business.</p><h2>Any Clown Can Cut Costs (or Attempt to Build Traffic with Discounts)</h2>					</div>

				<p>There are always obvious ways to <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-cost-cutting-ideas-part-one" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cut costs</a>, but what’s more often the case (than implementing systems and process optimization as a means to gain improvements to productivity and profits) can be likened to archaic battlefield wound care — amputations with blunt tools and unsanitary conditions that, should the patient survive the expected infections and unnecessary pain and further risk to self, must then also go on with permanent scars and disfigurements, both mental and physical.</p><p>When a product is discounted on a percentage basis, a message is broadcast to all communicating a sentiment of desolation. If the signals are surprising and shameful enough for a brand to attract the attention of those looking for such things, you can be sure it is a beacon and distress call also heard by the wider public (the affluent and affluent-minded, investors, media, etc.).</p><p>We recommend against chumming the waters with your brand — especially when there are so many other better ways to attract positive attention and traffic with strategies more sustainable than competitive price wars.</p><h2>Your Prize: How to Size and Prioritize Restaurant P&amp;L Opportunities</h2><p>A holistic approach is essential for foodservice industry businesses. Supply chain, purchasing, marketing, operations, finance, training, IT — all of these functional areas have to work together. Targeting line-items to reduce costs may limit the potential gains if pursued entirely in isolation.</p><p>Here are some ways we recommend prioritizing optimization initiatives:</p><h3>1. Learn Triage Techniques</h3><p>Context and contrast can help distinguish between mountains and molehills. If a patient has a bullet would and a splinter, we know what to address first. Apply the same logic to your restaurant P&amp;L.</p><h3>2. Pick the Right Wars</h3><p>Most management efforts and resources are expended fighting fires (because it seems less costly than what is required to invest in fire prevention and faster suppression systems). Be your own insurer and plan ahead.</p><h3>3. Play the Long Game</h3><p>We encourage our clients to think and plan on parallel paths: short-term wins are necessary to gain momentum and fund longer-term initiatives, but lasting organizations that transform the industry look past the next earnings call to three-, five-, and ten-year horizons — and beyond.</p><h3>4. Know Not Every Wound Requires Amputation</h3><p>And not every headache necessitates a lobotomy. Some symptoms do not only require an OTC medication but if symptoms are chronic and pervasive they justify professional attention and care. If certain areas keep coming up (as a pain-point in the P&amp;L) and aren&#8217;t being solved by a standard Google search, it probably deserves a trip to the doctor for a second opinion.</p><h3>5. Think Set of Scalpels, Not Single Saw</h3><p>The best surgeons of yesterday used hacksaws. Today, they use laser-cut scalpels. Tomorrow, they’ll use robotically controlled lasers over 5G networks. Similarly, the cost-cutting approaches many operators use today is on par with sawing off limbs with a hacksaw, even though the tools available to them currently are much more precise (and the <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-innovation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">capabilities of non-invasive precision</a> are improving by the day).</p><h3>6. Measure Twice, Cut Once</h3><p>A great rule for carpenters, of course, but the same thought process can and should be applied to the restaurant P&amp;L. Find the happy medium between haphazard (potentially uninformed) decision making and analysis-paralysis to gain traction and make meaningful progress while making confident and sure-footed decisions.</p><h3>7. Implement Imagination Over Iteration</h3><p>Incrementalism can easily lead <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-strategic-planning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">corporate planning</a> astray. The notion of ‘realistic’, consistent, inflation-adjusted results can create an illusion of safety from unexpected challenges and challengers. In scenario modeling, it’s best to think through the best and worst scenarios before landing on a target case.</p><p>Fewer executives feel they have the time or luxury of spending time ‘imagining’ (some may call this consternation), but we’re convinced there absolutely has to be someone — a person, function, or budget allocation —  set aside for imagining the future and the role (opportunities and risks) of your company in that new future.</p><p>Systematically relaying back company telemetry and trajectory for corporate captains to consider to chart their course with the most and best options still within the capabilities of their ship, versus windows of opportunity missed by putting off to tomorrow that which should command at least a fraction more mindshare today.</p><h3>8. Conquer Cognitive Bias</h3><p>While habit is a virtue in keeping healthy, it’s a steep ditch on a sharp-curve road for <a href="https://aaronallen.com/strategic-advisory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">corporate strategy</a>; vigilance, stamina, objectivity, and challenging the status quo are more virtuous attributes in shaping, and rhythmically reimagining, the future and vision for your company.</p><h3>9. Overcome Organizational and Industry Inertia</h3><p>Just as radar technology has improved dramatically for the weather industry, the same advancements can be made to corporate preparedness. The best and most successful companies (across sectors) worldwide are making investments into CAPEX, R&amp;D, intelligence, and their own organizations with a determination to win that can easily demoralize anyone half-heartedly standing up against it.</p><h3>10. Hire Challengers to Help You Defeat Competitors</h3><p>While nobody can make foolproof forecasts (if we could, wouldn&#8217;t we all be at the horse track or sitting on lottery winnings elsewhere?), prudent and diligent monitoring of the industry and really studying the dynamics driving it — and what those drivers will be in the future — can advance organizations.</p><h3>11. Enlist Scientists and Storytellers</h3><p>It can be exponentially beneficial to have an objective and outside view to help imagine and craft a new, more compelling future for your company that can inspire others essential to helping you pull your current-state conditions and future-state ambitions into closer proximity.</p><h2>Objectivity Looks Past Organizational Limitations</h2><p>Hiring in a top-tier consultancy can be expensive, so it often requires authorizations and endorsement of the <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/sleepless-restaurant-ceo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CEO</a>. This elevates expectations and commitment levels of all stakeholders involved and also ensures there is sufficient buy-in, collaboration, and availability of requisite resources to produce the best possible outcomes.</p><p>Approaching the business as if it were for sale (thinking &#8220;if we were being looked at by an investor, what would they find — both good and bad?&#8221;) can enable a broader perspective and help identify areas of opportunity through enhanced capabilities and resources. </p>					</div>

				<p>Capital is cheaper and more available than ever, and at least in the U.S. corporate profits are at record levels. Many organizations are using this opportunity to make <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-mergers-and-acquisitions">strategic acquisitions</a> or to increase stock prices by <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/stock-buybacks-dividend-distributions">buying back shares</a> and paying out larger dividends. But the strong correlation between CAPEX investments and revenue growth argues for a different strategy: putting capital back into the system.</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Public restaurants in the U.S. that spent 10.4% or more on CAPEX between 2012 and 2017 experienced an average of 11.9% revenue growth, almost twice the 6.0% average CAGR.</li>
 	<li>Despite being able to delegate the costs of new units, remodels, and upgrades to franchisees, highly franchised systems still devote an average 5.9% of their revenue to capital expenditures.</li>
</ul>
For chains with smaller footprints, adding units can help quickly add revenue. For those operations that have reached the saturation point, updating and remodeling locations not only allows for improvements in efficiency and tech integration but also builds excitement among guests and media. Indeed, both in- and outside the restaurant industry, investments in technology are creating incredible ROIs in the form of increased market cap and valuation. But not all CAPEX is created equal: these investments work best when they align with long-term <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-strategic-planning">strategic planning</a> informed by a comprehensive understanding of the factors and forces shaping the <a href="https://aaronallen.com/restaurant-research">global restaurant industry</a>.

				<p>There is a slight variance across business models. On average, highly franchised systems only allocate half a percentage point less of their revenue to CAPEX than moderately franchised systems. While this seems to contradict the model, where highly franchised chains pass the majority of opening costs onto franchisees, the difference likely comes from the fact that these are the largest systems. For example, though neither Starbucks nor McDonald’s have top-quartile CAPEX spending as a percentage of revenue, their investments account for 48% of spend for all public restaurants in the U.S.</p><p>Since the beginning of 2016, McDonald’s has spent an average $484m every quarter on CAPEX. To properly scale that figure, it is more than 21x Burger King’s average annual CAPEX allocations for 2016 and 2017. So far in 2018, McDonald’s is spending even more, with an average $600m capital investment every quarter. In a recent earnings call, CEO Steve Easterbrook explained that his goal is to “build a moat around the business.” $2.4b in CAPEX investments will do just that, protecting the QSR mainstay from most competitors.</p>					</div>

				<p>The variance between top and bottom CAPEX investors in 2017 was 2.3x, with top-quartile spend equaling or exceeding 7.3% and bottom-quartile spend equaling or falling below 3.2%. Most likely, the companies saving revenue by not investing in CAPEX will pay for it in other ways, from lost growth to inefficiencies in their units that slow down throughput.</p><p>Not all CAPEX is created equal, and different business models recommend different kinds of <a href="https://aaronallen.com/restaurant-investment">restaurant investments</a>. Three strategies — new-store openings, system-wide remodels, and tech and infrastructure improvements — seem to create the most revenue growth.</p><h2>CAPEX Strategy One: New Store Openings</h2><p>Lightly franchised systems invest 6.0% of revenue in CAPEX, much of it devoted to opening new locations and updating existing units. For younger and smaller systems, adding more units, if supported by a <a href="https://aaronallen.com/growth-and-expansion">strong real-estate strategy</a>, can quickly increase sales. Shake Shack successfully pursued this strategy, investing 19.6% of its revenue into CAPEX between 2012 and 2017. The better-burger concept’s aggressive expansion strategy netted it a stunning 44.5% revenue CAGR.</p><p>In 2017, Chipotle allocated 70% of its CAPEX funds (amounting to some $152b) on opening 183 new locations. Considering the fast-casual pioneer has yet to really pursue international expansion — it has 29 locations outside the U.S. — it’s clear that it can continue to build revenue through physical expansion, whether via company-owned units or regional master franchisees.</p><p><a href="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Fast-Casual-Restaurant-CAPEX-Investments.png"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-12328 alignleft" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Fast-Casual-Restaurant-CAPEX-Investments-1024x676.png" alt="Fast Casual Restaurant CAPEX Investments" width="525" height="347" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Fast-Casual-Restaurant-CAPEX-Investments-1024x676.png 1024w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Fast-Casual-Restaurant-CAPEX-Investments-350x231.png 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Fast-Casual-Restaurant-CAPEX-Investments-300x198.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Fast-Casual-Restaurant-CAPEX-Investments-768x507.png 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Fast-Casual-Restaurant-CAPEX-Investments.png 1519w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px" /></a>It’s no coincidence that these two examples come from the fast-casual segment, which has the highest CAPEX spend among publicly traded restaurants in the U.S.</p><p>Fast-casual chains, on average, devote 8.5% of their revenue to CAPEX, almost three percentage points higher than casual-dining or QSR concepts, which both have an average CAPEX-to-revenue ration of 5.7%. This difference likely comes down to these operations’ rapid expansion strategies, as fast casual has the lowest construction costs of these three segments.</p><p>The median cost of opening a new fast-casual unit is $1m, $200k less than opening a QSR and $1.6m less than opening a CDR. Of course, there’s incredible variability within each set. The least capital-intensive quick-service chain (Subway), only requires $300k in construction, while new Panera Bread units cost $1.5m to build. (Casual dining has the widest variability, a 183% swing.) If backed by strong real-estate strategies, these construction costs can be quickly repaid through sales.</p><p><a href="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Restaurant-CAPEX-Construction-Costs.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-12329 size-full" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Restaurant-CAPEX-Construction-Costs.png" alt="" width="1519" height="1005" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Restaurant-CAPEX-Construction-Costs.png 1519w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Restaurant-CAPEX-Construction-Costs-350x232.png 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Restaurant-CAPEX-Construction-Costs-300x198.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Restaurant-CAPEX-Construction-Costs-768x508.png 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Restaurant-CAPEX-Construction-Costs-1024x677.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1519px) 100vw, 1519px" /></a></p><h2>CAPEX Strategy Two: Remodels and Retrofits</h2><p>Chains that have reached the limits of location saturation can still benefit from CAPEX investments in order to increase sales on the unit level through remodels and retrofits. In fact, Chipotle devoted much of the rest of its $216.8b 2017 CAPEX spend on improving existing units, and this has been a guiding strategy in Easterbrook’s turnaround strategy for McDonald’s.</p><p>In 2018, the burger chain is remodeling 4,000 of its units — a small percentage of its 36k+ locations globally but no small undertaking. It will fully transform 1,320 to the Experience of the Future design and partially update the rest. In its Q2-2018 earnings call, Easterbrook reported that even these partial remodels were bringing in mid-single digit sales lifts. While these investments can become costly, top-performing chains can realize returns on those allocations quickly.</p><p><a href="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Restaurant-CAPEX-Remodel-ROI.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-large wp-image-12330" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Restaurant-CAPEX-Remodel-ROI-1024x678.png" alt="" width="525" height="348" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Restaurant-CAPEX-Remodel-ROI-1024x678.png 1024w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Restaurant-CAPEX-Remodel-ROI-350x232.png 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Restaurant-CAPEX-Remodel-ROI-300x199.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Restaurant-CAPEX-Remodel-ROI-768x509.png 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Restaurant-CAPEX-Remodel-ROI.png 1519w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px" /></a>Among the largest systems in the U.S., the average ROI for remodeling and retrofitting projects reaches 15.4%. More than updating the décor, top performers use these initiatives to build productivity enhancements into the system by integrating new technologies, updating layouts (including incorporating drive-thrus), and improving signage, menu boards, and back-of-house equipment. Differences in the quality of these remodels and retrofits produces a 69% difference between top and bottom quartiles. In other words, it takes the bottom quartile 3.6 more years to recover the investment than high-performing chains.</p><h2>CAPEX Strategy Three: Technology and Infrastructure</h2><p>Outside the restaurant industry, tech companies are currently engaged in what Bloomberg has called a CAPEX “war,” increasing allocations for capital expenditures 68% in Q1-2018. Amazon, for one, is projected to spend $13b in CAPEX in 2018, almost 4x its spend in 2013. More than a third of that amount, some $5b, will go to content creation, as it tries to best Netflix, which is projected to spend $8b on content). This represents more than half of the streaming service&#8217;s projected 2018 revenue, but only 5.2% of its $153b market cap.</p><p>Netflix is willing to devote so much of its revenue to content creation because it recognizes the power of investing in intangible assets. The majority of value (84%) on the S&amp;P 500 comes from these assets, which include brand recognition, goodwill and intellectual property.</p>					</div>

				<p>In the restaurant industry, <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/dominos-turnaround">Domino’s</a> has followed this tech-focused strategy for the past eight years. In 2010, the pizza chain reinvented itself as a tech company that happens to sell pizza and increased enterprise value $12b in the process. Interestingly, however, one of the biggest categories of CAPEX spend in 2017 wasn’t digital or mobile, but brick-and-mortar supply chain centers. These centralized commissaries will help the chain ensure consistent — and much-improved — taste over its 97% franchised system. They also represent a significant source of income for the company: in 2017, 62% of Domino’s revenue came from its supply chain.</p><p>The other big tech investor in foodservice is Starbucks. In 2015, Howard Schulz attributed same-store sales increases to the introduction of its Mobile Order &amp; Pay capability. The following year, the chain nearly doubled its investments in digital initiatives, increasing from $145m to $275m. In 2015, almost 20% of Starbucks CAPEX expenditures went to technology, and by the end of 2017, mobile orders accounted for 30% of all transactions.</p><h2>Guest Satisfaction Has Greatest Impact on Long-Term Success</h2><p>While the coffee chain’s investments kept same-store sales high through 2016, comps have started to slide, leading to the recent shake-up in top leadership. CEO Kevin Johnson explained that the reorganization was designed to “increase the velocity of innovation” at Starbucks. These comments underline how quickly consumer preferences, habits, and expectations are changing — and how hard it is to keep up. The challenge only increases in large systems, where updates to physical locations and digital assets must take place in hundreds, if not thousands, of individual units.</p><p>This news reminds us who really determines foodservice operations’ fates: the guests. Adding units to grow this customer base, remodeling existing locations to improve efficiency — and therefore guest satisfaction — and investing in technology and infrastructure are all designed with the guest in mind, so it’s not surprising to see organizations that make these capital expenditures experience above-average revenue growth.</p><p>But, as the recent news from Starbucks shows, CAPEX spend needs to be backed by <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-strategic-planning">careful planning</a>. The first challenge is knowing how to right-size initiatives to the system, balancing strategy for both short-term wins and long-term priorities. The second challenge is ensuring that these investments appropriately respond to the factors and forces shaping the foodservice industry so that the organization continues to meet — and hopefully exceed — guest expectations.</p><h3>About Aaron Allen &amp; Associates</h3><div><p><a href="https://aaronallen.com/about-us">Aaron Allen &amp; Associates</a> works with global foodservice leaders to find, size, and seize opportunities to drive growth, optimize performance, and maximize <span style="text-decoration-line: none;">enterprise value</span>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since the 2008 financial crash, <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-commercial-lending">restaurant loans</a> have slowly started to increase. While there are risks to lending to restaurant companies — relatively few barriers to entry and hard-to-protect <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-chain-intellectual-property" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">intellectual property</a> — the size of the global restaurant industry ($2.7t) makes foodservice an appealing market for bank loans and credit lines. At the same time, the dominance of multinational chains and large restaurant operators has reduced the risk on commercial investment to those companies.</p>
<p>Both <a href="https://www.bofaml.com/en-us/content/restaurant-finance-group-franchise-loans-financing.html">Bank of America</a> and <a href="https://www.wellsfargo.com/com/industry/restaurants/">Wells Fargo</a> have extended credit to major restaurant brands.</p>
<div class="infogram-embed" data-id="69740c3b-9c20-4837-ba72-faa547850310" data-type="interactive" data-title="US Restaurant Interest Rates"></div>
<p><script>!function(e,t,n,s){var i="InfogramEmbeds",o=e.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?"http:":"https:";if(/^\/{2}/.test(s)&&(s=d+s),window[i]&&window[i].initialized)window[i].process&&window[i].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var a=e.createElement(t);a.async=1,a.id=n,a.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(a,o)}}(document,"script","infogram-async","https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js");</script></p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, larger, more established operations have easier (and cheaper) access to commercial lending. For example, Darden secured a $750m credit line (equivalent to 9% of its annual revenue) and Dave &amp; Buster’s $800m (80% of annual revenue). But some big players — like Chipotle and The Cheesecake Factory — take on no debt whatsoever, choosing to finance their growth and expansion with equity. While debt can become dangerous, equity-only operations may be suboptimal.</p>
<p>Among publicly traded companies in the U.S., those with the most leverage used debt to finance stock buyback and dividend payments. While the steady pace of regular interest payments may keep management teams focused on optimizing performance, rising interest rates may turn these debt obligations into debilitating burdens.</p>
<h2>Restaurant Companies Refinancing Existing Debt to Lower Interest Payments</h2>
<p>Looking at a restaurant company’s interest expenses as a percentage of its operating cash flows shows which operations are best positioned to meet their debt obligations.</p>
<p>In 2017, the median interest-to-operating-cash-flow ratio for public restaurant companies was 8%. The operations with the largest ratios incurred at least $0.27 in interest expenses for each dollar of operating cash flow — 3.4x the industry median. With a 150% ratio, Nathan’s Famous has the dubious honor of leading the pack: $14.7m in interest expenses with only $10.4m in operating cash flow.</p>
<p><a href="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/restaurant-loans-restaurant-interest-rates-overall.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/restaurant-loans-restaurant-interest-rates-overall.png" alt="Publicly traded restaurants spend a median 8% of operating cash flow on interest expenses" width="1519" height="1006" /></a></p>
<p>Debt expenses are clearly burdening the heavily franchised hot dog restaurant, and its ability to meet them is questionable. In November 2017, it  issued a $150m round of senior secured notes to refinance debt it took on in 2015. The move is expected to lower their interest payments by $3.6m a year.</p>
<p>Several companies have no outstanding long-term debt, including Chipotle, Texas Roadhouse, and Yum! China. Their extremely low financial leverage offers these companies the opportunity to raise debt if they require additional capital. Also, thanks to rising interest rates, these operations are freed from incurring higher expenses that could hurt their bottom line.</p>
<p>However, a debt-free restaurant company may have a suboptimal capital structure as a result of forgone tax shields or simply because equity financing can be more expensive than debt financing. A 100% equity-funded operation may also lead to a lack of cash flow discipline: when management teams have debt, they tend to pursue fewer speculative projects, instead focusing on increasing efficiency and ensuring investments pay off so they can meet their debt obligations.</p>
<h2>Financing Dividends and Buybacks with Debt Creating High Interest Burden for Heavily Franchised Chains</h2>
<p>Heavily franchised restaurants have the highest median interest-to-operating-cash-flow ratios in the foodservice industry. For each dollar generated in operating cash flow, they incur $0.24 in interest expenses: 6.2x the median ratio for lightly franchised operations.</p>
<p><a href="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Restaurant-loans-restaurant-interest-rates-by-franchise.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Restaurant-loans-restaurant-interest-rates-by-franchise.png" alt="Heavily franchised public restaurant companies paying 6.2x the interest expenses as lightly franchised restaurants" width="1519" height="1006" /></a></p>
<p>Some of the heavily franchised chains have issued additional long-term debt in order to finance special dividends and to boost share buyback initiatives.</p>
<p>For instance, in connection with their strategic transformation plans, Yum! Brands (in the U.S.) increased its indebtedness from about $4b to approximately $10b. The proceeds from this debt were mainly used to return capital to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends. The ratio of interest expense to operating cash flow for the company is 45.9%.</p>
<p>Wendy’s ratio implies that the company incurred $0.47 in interest expenses for each dollar contributed by the company’s operations. Between 2014 and 2017, the company’s debt-to-equity ratio went up six times, from 0.8x to 4.8x. Considering the recent rise in interest rates, Wendy’s may have loaded its balance sheet with too much debt.</p>
<h2>Cheaper Access Allows Large-Cap Restaurant to Take on More Debt</h2>
<p>Large-cap restaurant companies have the highest median interest-to-operating-cash-flow ratios in the foodservice industry. They incur a median of $0.17 in interest for each dollar of operating cash flow, 2.6x and 1.7x the median ratios of mid- and small-cap restaurant companies.</p>
<p><a href="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Restaurant-loans-restaurant-interest-rates-by-cap.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Restaurant-loans-restaurant-interest-rates-by-cap.png" alt="Median Interest Expense to Operating Cash Flow U-Shaped: Higher Ratios for Large and Micro Caps " width="1519" height="1006" /></a></p>
<p>Large organizations, including Yum! Brands, McDonald’s, and Starbucks, have cheaper access to outside financing for each dollar borrowed. Based on 2017’s year-end interest expenses and the average debt for 2016 and 2017, we estimate that Starbucks pays 2.5% on its debt, while Yum! pays 5%. In contrast, small-cap companies are paying much higher rates: Carrols pays an estimated 7.8%, and Nathan’s Famous pays 11.2%.</p>
<p>Large-cap operations are also less susceptible to bankruptcy because they tend to be more diversified, with locations across the globe, allowing them to take on more debt. In contrast, small-cap companies have more volatile cash flow streams, which makes servicing debt more challenging.</p>
<p>Right-sizing debt and equity for a company’s strategic goals is an important task, one that can either set an operation up for long-term success or drag it down with ballooning interest payments. In this instance, external advisors with a more comprehensive view of the foodservice landscape, commercial lending benchmarks, trends, and forecasts, and the factors and forces affecting the industry can help executives make the best decision for their company’s future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a central element of any company’s regular reporting, restaurant income statements can be sliced a variety of ways to quickly uncover inefficiencies. These ratios also demonstrate the very different business models of heavily and lightly franchised systems.</p>
<h2>Median Revenue per Employee in Public Restaurant Companies $61.3k</h2>
<p>Compared to other industries, public restaurant companies in the U.S. have relatively low revenue-per-employee rates. Energy companies make just under $1.8m per employee, and supermarkets make $196.7k per employee, but the median revenue per employee in publicly traded restaurants in the U.S. is $61.3k.</p>
<p>But even within this rank, the results show a misleading disparity. Restaurant Brands International (RBI) made $871,638 per employee in 2017, but that’s because, as a 100% franchised system, they have only 6,200 employees. In comparison, Chipotle had a similar revenue level ($4.5b), but, with almost 70k employees, their ratio was less than a tenth of RBI’s, at $67,083.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11627" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Restaurant-Income-Statements-Revenue-Per-Employee.png" alt="restaurant income statements revenue per employee" width="1622" height="1075" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Restaurant-Income-Statements-Revenue-Per-Employee.png 1622w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Restaurant-Income-Statements-Revenue-Per-Employee-350x232.png 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Restaurant-Income-Statements-Revenue-Per-Employee-300x199.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Restaurant-Income-Statements-Revenue-Per-Employee-768x509.png 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Restaurant-Income-Statements-Revenue-Per-Employee-1024x679.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1622px) 100vw, 1622px" /></p>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum, Yum! China has the lowest revenue per employee, with just $16k. The company was spun-off from Yum! Brands in 2016, making it relatively young. In 2017 alone, it added 30k new employees — a typical move for young organizations that want to fill out all the available positions and prepare for increasing demand while revenues are still growing.</p>
<h2>Net Profit per Employee Sits at $2.0k</h2>
<p>Having the highest revenue per employee doesn’t mean the company has a high net profit per employee. Dine Brands — another highly franchised system — had the second highest revenue per employee ($806k), and it also has the lowest net income per employee, amounting to a $447k loss for every worker.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11625" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Restaurant-Income-Statements-Net-Profit-per-Employee.png" alt="restaurant income statements net profit per employee" width="1622" height="1075" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Restaurant-Income-Statements-Net-Profit-per-Employee.png 1622w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Restaurant-Income-Statements-Net-Profit-per-Employee-350x232.png 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Restaurant-Income-Statements-Net-Profit-per-Employee-300x199.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Restaurant-Income-Statements-Net-Profit-per-Employee-768x509.png 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Restaurant-Income-Statements-Net-Profit-per-Employee-1024x679.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1622px) 100vw, 1622px" /></p>
<p>In 2017, the company reported a net loss of $330.5m thanks to deteriorating profit margins from large debt expenses, lower royalty income due to franchisees’ weakened sales, and an increase in capital allocation to the Applebee’s national advertising fund. The company counts only 520 employees.</p>
<p>On the other side, Dunkin’ Brands’ net profit-per-employee ratio of $3.1m is the highest in the industry. With a 100% franchise rate, the employees at the unit level are not included in the employee count.</p>
<h2>Food Costs Hit High-20% Range for Most Segments</h2>
<p>Coffee/beverage/snack chains have a median food-cost-to-sales ratio of 13.4%, which is well below other segments, most of which have ratios in the high 20s.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11623" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Restaurant-Income-Statements-Food-Costs.png" alt="restaurant income statement food cost" width="1576" height="1075" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Restaurant-Income-Statements-Food-Costs.png 1576w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Restaurant-Income-Statements-Food-Costs-350x239.png 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Restaurant-Income-Statements-Food-Costs-300x205.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Restaurant-Income-Statements-Food-Costs-768x524.png 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Restaurant-Income-Statements-Food-Costs-1024x698.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1576px) 100vw, 1576px" /></p>
<p>Relying heavily on beverages and light snacks, which allow for higher margins than other segments, keeps this segment’s food costs low.</p>
<p>The fast-casual segment has the highest medianfood costs (28.9%) due to increasing commodity prices and deteriorating same-store sales at many chains in the segment, following the burst of the fast-casual bubble.</p>
<h2>Median Labor Costs at 29.1%</h2>
<p>Based on public restaurant companies’ 10-K forms, the industry median is 29% in labor costs. Top-quartile companies, which in this instance indicates the weakest performers, had labor costs eating at least 34% of their revenue.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11624" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Restaurant-Income-Statements-Labor-Costs.png" alt="restaurant income statements labor cost" width="1576" height="1075" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Restaurant-Income-Statements-Labor-Costs.png 1576w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Restaurant-Income-Statements-Labor-Costs-350x239.png 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Restaurant-Income-Statements-Labor-Costs-300x205.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Restaurant-Income-Statements-Labor-Costs-768x524.png 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Restaurant-Income-Statements-Labor-Costs-1024x698.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1576px) 100vw, 1576px" /></p>
<p>In 2017, Kona Grill’s labor costs as a percentage of revenue rose to 36.7% from 35.1% in 2016, reflecting increased expenses at newly opened locations. Of course, wages at new locations and start-ups will always be higher, as there are not yet sales to offset them. If pre-opening labor costs go toward  training and enculturation programs, the slight increase will pay off in the future.</p>
<p>On the other side, McDonald’s had a very low labor cost, again thanks to <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/franchise-restaurant-earnings-per-share">franchise rate</a>, which is projected to reach 90% this year. Only 235k employees are counted in its labor costs, a tiny proportion of the line-level employees, managers, and franchisees that staff its 36k+ locations worldwide. It has also introduced self-order kiosks, which could cut labor costs over the long-run, though the company has publicly stated that it does not intend to replace employees.</p>
<h2>Median Occupancy Cost for Publicly Traded Companies in the U.S. 7.9%</h2>
<p>The median occupancy costs for publicly traded restaurant companies in the U.S. sits at 7.9%. <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-investors">Struggling sandwich chain</a> Potbelly incurred the highest occupancy costs, at 14%. This figure  surged by 11.7% to $58.6m in 2017, mainly due to new store openings and an increase in rent expenses, real estate taxes, and common area maintenance, combined with declining same-store sales in company-operated locations.</p>

<p>On the other side, Denny’s incurred only 4% occupancy costs thanks to the company’s high franchise rate (90% of locations), which passes those expenses on to franchisees.</p>
<p>These ratios show how much franchising can cut down costs across all aspects of a restaurant operation, but they don’t demonstrate how franchising cuts revenue, since sales are kept by franchisees, or how it can impact intangible value by diluting the brand.</p>
<p>There’s no magic formula for the rate of franchise-to-company-operated units. Instead, leadership teams should consider how franchising ripples out across areas of the operation and make the choices the best align with the organization’s long-term strategy and unique value proposition.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Restaurant executives have to decide whether they want to be a tortoise or a hare. In the age-old fable, the tortoise moves ploddingly down the race course — slow and steady — eventually surpassing the hare, whose off-the-blocks speed can’t make up for his overconfident blundering.</p>
<p>In Aesop, the choice is easy: be the tortoise. In business, it’s much more complicated.</p>
<p>Operators must balance long-term initiatives against shareholders’ desire for short-term returns. Restaurants’ <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurants-are-investing-less-in-capex">capital expenditure</a> investments in <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/pizza-restaurant-technology">technology</a>, unit remodels, and new units boost revenue and create substantial value over the long-term, but, over the past two decades, many publicly traded foodservice companies in the U.S. have used their extra capital on <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/stock-buybacks-dividend-distributions">share buybacks</a>, dividend payouts, and acquisitions.</p>
<p>While the market is rewarding this hare-like thinking, a number of companies have taken a slower approach — and seen incredible increases in profit margins, stock price, and enterprise value.</p>
<h2>Buybacks and Dividends Eating Into Restaurant Capital Expenditure</h2>
<p>CAPEX spending can have a negative effect on short-term profits, which motivates some investors to sell shares. Other shareholders might move their capital to companies that use their non-operating cash flow to generate immediate gains, like dividends and stock buybacks.</p>
<p>Most publicly traded foodservice companies in the U.S. are listening to their investors and using the record amounts of cash on hand to generate short-term returns rather than long-term results.</p>

<p>Though the amount of restaurant capital expenditure hasn’t changed significantly since 2001, the share of capital going to CAPEX has decreased by 42 percentage points.</p>

<p>The focus on dividends and buybacks seems to be having a negative effect on enterprise value: as CAPEX spending has decreased, EV growth has as well.</p>

<p>Ten companies went against the grain during this period and increased their CAPEX spend, and each claimed both stock price and EV gains. Further, nine of ten saw profit margins and revenue increase with CAPEX spends.</p>

<p>Here are three good reason to increase CAPEX investments — with one big warning.</p>
<h2>1. Investing CAPEX in Technology Offers Restaurants Competitive Advantage</h2>
<p>All ten of the companies listed above have focused on technology: integrating smart systems into the supply chain, developing mobile ordering capability, and rolling out automated kiosks and state-of-the-art point-of-sale (POS) systems.</p>
<p>For instance, <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/dominos-turnaround">Domino’s</a> has invested approximately $214.2m (2.8% of 2015–17 revenue) in capital expenditures since 2015. Most of that capital went to supply chain centers, a proprietary POS system (Domino’s PULSE), a digital ordering platform, and internal enterprise systems.</p>
<p>Domino’s saw a surge of 184% in stock returns and a boost of 110% in enterprise value since 2013 thanks to its impressive — and immersive — digital experience. Now, Domino’s likes to think of itself as “an e-commerce company that sells pizza.”</p>
<div class="infogram-embed" data-id="b318fc9c-bdf3-4fbd-bc5a-269b7eb497e1" data-type="interactive" data-title="Domino&amp;#39;s Stock"></div>
<p><script>!function(e,t,n,s){var i="InfogramEmbeds",o=e.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?"http:":"https:";if(/^\/{2}/.test(s)&&(s=d+s),window[i]&&window[i].initialized)window[i].process&&window[i].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var a=e.createElement(t);a.async=1,a.id=n,a.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(a,o)}}(document,"script","infogram-async","https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js");</script></p>
<p>Other chains, including Sonic, Cracker Barrel, Del Taco, and Dave &amp; Buster’s, have also invested in proprietary POS platforms, mobile ordering systems, and self-service kiosks. During peak rush hours, line-busting digital ordering allows patrons to order and cash out on the spot. CEO Cliff Hudson promised that <a href="https://sonicfranchises.com/blog/sonic-drive-franchise-leverages-technology/">Sonic’s Integrated Customer Engagement</a> platform, or ICE, will become “the most personalized customer experience in QSR.” These tech investments allow chains to increase their store’s performance while enhancing the customer experience.</p>
<p>Finally, smart use of tech and digital delivers massive amounts of data, which restaurants can use to understand what’s driving revenue and profit. This has allowed them to become more adaptive and responsive, allocating extra funding to areas and initiatives that are working and changing course on projects that haven’t delivered.</p>
<h2>2. New &amp; Remodeled Locations Create Foundation for Sustainable Success</h2>
<p>All ten restaurants in the group allocated significant CAPEX to new-store openings. In 2017, Flanigan’s purchased property and equipment for $7.2m and spent $2.4m on construction.</p>
<p>Ruth’s CAPEX investments went mostly to acquiring six franchisee-owned restaurants, and, in 2016, Cracker Barrel launched Holler &amp; Dash, a fresh fast-casual concept serving a Southern-style menu to a younger segment.</p>
<p><a href="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Holler-Dash-Trying-to-Win-New-Segment-of-Diner.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-11018" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Holler-Dash-Trying-to-Win-New-Segment-of-Diner-1024x633-1.jpg" alt="Holler &amp; Dash Trying to Win New Segment of Diner" width="980" height="606" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Holler-Dash-Trying-to-Win-New-Segment-of-Diner-1024x633-1.jpg 1024w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Holler-Dash-Trying-to-Win-New-Segment-of-Diner-350x216.jpg 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Holler-Dash-Trying-to-Win-New-Segment-of-Diner-300x185-1.jpg 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Holler-Dash-Trying-to-Win-New-Segment-of-Diner-768x474-1.jpg 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Holler-Dash-Trying-to-Win-New-Segment-of-Diner-970x599.png 970w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Holler-Dash-Trying-to-Win-New-Segment-of-Diner-500x309.png 500w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Holler-Dash-Trying-to-Win-New-Segment-of-Diner-640x395.png 640w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Holler-Dash-Trying-to-Win-New-Segment-of-Diner-201x124.png 201w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Holler-Dash-Trying-to-Win-New-Segment-of-Diner-146x90.png 146w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Holler-Dash-Trying-to-Win-New-Segment-of-Diner.jpg 1431w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px" /></a></p>
<p>Cracker Barrel’s risk has paid off, and Holler &amp; Dash has rapidly opened new units across Georgia, Tennessee, and Florida. In 2017, Good Times Restaurants spent $9.1m to develop Bad Daddy’s locations in Colorado and North Carolina.</p>
<h2>3. Investing in Remodeling Initiatives Boosts Traffic and Drives Sales</h2>
<p>Besides openings, many restaurants allocated funds to improve or renovate existing restaurants. Ark Restaurants has spent big on renovating Sequoia, and Del Taco launched Ambiance Shake-Up, a remodeling initiative that cost an average $45,000 per store.</p>
<p>The program has helped accelerate same-store sales by aligning the unit design with the brand image. Del Taco witnessed a 243% increase in enterprise value and 117% increase in profit margin from 2013 to 2017. The big boost in profit margin came from menu engineering and supply chain optimization.</p>
<h2>Warning: Markets Not Rewarding CAPEX Post-Financial Crisis</h2>
<p>While these ten companies have landed on successful strategies for translating CAPEX investments into revenue and enterprise value boosts, there’s good reason to tread carefully. Before the 2008 crisis, higher-than-median CAPEX restaurants outperformed low-CAPEX companies in most years, likely owing to their growth prospects and general economic optimism. However, the financial crisis hit these organizations harder, and they incurred greater losses compared to their low-CAPEX peers.</p>
<p>Since 2008, the markets have rewarded low-CAPEX companies — many of which include highly franchised systems — for their conservative behavior, and many operations have remained cautious, investing only in carefully examined opportunities that are anticipated to create value.</p>
<p>Since 2015, the median stock return for high-CAPEX restaurants has been negative­ (-10% in 2015, -8% in 2016, and -3% in 2017). These companies are hindered by high operating and interest expenses arising from the debt often used to finance CAPEX.</p>

<p>Not all CAPEX spending is created equal. Naturally, a restaurant chain that spends heavily on opening new locations before the industry begins contracting will have a very different fate than one that expands as the market is booming. Inventing a new inventory system that doesn’t actually improve efficiency costs the same amount of money as developing one that increases margins. The secret is making strategic capital investments because these are proven to increase revenue and boost value.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s no secret that the operating margin is thinner in foodservice than almost anywhere else, owing to the fierce competition in the industry. However, some chains have achieved impressive results.</p>
<p>Companies with a defined focus that differentiates them from other operations have better operating margins than those organizations that try to do too much. Franchising also helps strengthen operating margins, as it spreads costs out among non-company-owned units.</p>
<h2>A Clear Focus Plus Low SG&amp;A Costs Boost Operating Margins</h2>
<p>Among publicly traded foodservice operations in the U.S., the top quartile has operating margins of at least 13.3%, 2.3x the industry median.</p>
<p>As it does in <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-gross-margin">gross</a> and <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-profit-margin">net profit margins</a>, Dunkin’ Brands leads the pack, making $0.52 in operating profit for every dollar of revenue — 9.0x the industry&#8217;s median of 5.7%.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10992" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Restaurants-Operating-Profit.png" alt="Restaurants Operating Profit" width="3232" height="2144" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Restaurants-Operating-Profit.png 3232w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Restaurants-Operating-Profit-350x232.png 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Restaurants-Operating-Profit-300x199.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Restaurants-Operating-Profit-768x509.png 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Restaurants-Operating-Profit-1024x679.png 1024w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Restaurants-Operating-Profit-970x643.png 970w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Restaurants-Operating-Profit-500x332.png 500w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Restaurants-Operating-Profit-640x425.png 640w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Restaurants-Operating-Profit-187x124.png 187w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Restaurants-Operating-Profit-136x90.png 136w" sizes="(max-width: 3232px) 100vw, 3232px" /></p>
<h2>Franchising Likely to Improve Gross Margin</h2>
<p>We can once again explain Dunkin’s high margins by pointing to its <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/franchise-restaurant-earnings-per-share">100% franchise rate</a> — the company doesn’t own a single location. Comparing the chain’s 84% gross margin to its 52% operating margin shows how much SG&amp;A costs can impact profitability.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10990" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Restaurant-Operating-Margin-and-Franchising.png" alt="Restaurant Operating Margin and Franchising" width="3228" height="2142" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Restaurant-Operating-Margin-and-Franchising.png 3228w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Restaurant-Operating-Margin-and-Franchising-350x232.png 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Restaurant-Operating-Margin-and-Franchising-300x199.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Restaurant-Operating-Margin-and-Franchising-768x510.png 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Restaurant-Operating-Margin-and-Franchising-1024x679.png 1024w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Restaurant-Operating-Margin-and-Franchising-970x644.png 970w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Restaurant-Operating-Margin-and-Franchising-500x332.png 500w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Restaurant-Operating-Margin-and-Franchising-640x425.png 640w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Restaurant-Operating-Margin-and-Franchising-187x124.png 187w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Restaurant-Operating-Margin-and-Franchising-136x90.png 136w" sizes="(max-width: 3228px) 100vw, 3228px" /></p>
<p>In fact, the lowest performer — Dine Brands, with a -60.9% margin — had large SG&amp;A expenses, mostly from hefty non-recurring cash severance and equity compensation charges related to the separation of the previous CEO, Applebee&#8217;s stabilization initiatives, and the parent company’s rebranding strategy.</p>
<p>Operating margin growth parallels increased franchise rates. Chains with two-thirds or more franchised locations enjoy the highest operating margins in the foodservice industry, with a median of 17.5% — 5.5x the lightly franchised (less than one-third franchise operated) chains’ median of 3.2%.</p>
<p>Heavily franchised chains such as Dunkin’ Brands, Wingstop, and McDonald’s are shielded from food and labor inflation concerns at the corporate level as the majority of these costs are shouldered by franchisees. Other operating expenses, such as advertising and marketing campaigns, are often shared between the franchisors and their franchisees, offering substantial relief to parent companies.</p>
<p>As rivalry intensifies among restaurants, many operations are looking for ways to boost sales, <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/how-to-reduce-restaurant-food-cost">reduce costs</a>, and improve these margins. While some chains are betting on a more focused value proposition, others are relying heavily on their franchise model to achieve those goals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gross margins consider the relationship between how much money a restaurant makes and how much money it took to generate that revenue in direct costs. High ratios indicate a lower cost of goods sold (COGS); a low gross margin indicates that the organization isn’t benefiting from high markups on its products.</p>
<p>Among top publicly traded players in the U.S. foodservice industry, operations with simplified menus and lean labor strategies have higher gross margins.</p>
<h2>High Labor Costs Cut Into Gross Margin</h2>
<p>Top-quartile U.S. foodservice chains generate a gross profit margin at least 1.8x the industry median (22.1%), earning at least $0.40 in gross profit for every dollar of revenue.</p>
<p><a href="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurant-Gross-Margins-in-the-US.png"></a><a href="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurant-Gross-Margins-in-the-US.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-10997" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurant-Gross-Margins-in-the-US-1024x675.png" alt="Restaurant Gross Margins in the US" width="980" height="646" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurant-Gross-Margins-in-the-US-1024x675.png 1024w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurant-Gross-Margins-in-the-US-350x231.png 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurant-Gross-Margins-in-the-US-300x198.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurant-Gross-Margins-in-the-US-768x507.png 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurant-Gross-Margins-in-the-US-970x640.png 970w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurant-Gross-Margins-in-the-US-500x330.png 500w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurant-Gross-Margins-in-the-US-640x422.png 640w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurant-Gross-Margins-in-the-US-188x124.png 188w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurant-Gross-Margins-in-the-US-136x90.png 136w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px" /></a></p>
<p>Dunkin’ Brands leads the pack, but its $0.84 in gross profit on each $1 in revenue is a little misleading. The coffee-and-donut chain is <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/franchise-restaurant-earnings-per-share">100% franchised</a>, meaning the parent company doesn’t cover any labor or food costs, which greatly reduces its COGS.</p>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum sits Good Times Restaurants. With a gross margin of only 9.6%, the QSR chain’s revenues barely cover the costs of goods sold. This low margin indicates that it will likely struggle to cover its operating and non-operating expenses, producing negative <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-operating-margin">operating</a> and <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-profit-margin">net profit</a> margins.</p>
<p>The low gross margin owes to high food and packaging costs. In 2017, beef and bacon prices surged at the same time that the company introduced improvements to its core menu, inflating the COGS line item. Further, because Good Times operates only in Colorado, where the labor market is pushing wages up, payroll costs have cut into profits.</p>
<h2>Lean Labor Helped Coffee/Breakfast Companies’ Gross Margins</h2>
<p>While increases in the price of bacon and beef hurt Good Times, the 8% decline in coffee prices over the same period handed companies in the coffee/breakfast segment COGS savings. Segment leaders Starbucks and Dunkin’ coupled this bonus with a lean labor strategy, which works to optimally staff each location based on expected traffic.</p>

<p>These companies have further expanded their reach by focusing on <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/digital-consumer-restaurant-trends">digital</a> and off-premise sales, offering virtually infinite opportunities for growth.</p>
<p>High gross margins imply a robust restaurant operation, but this ratio is just one piece of the puzzle when assessing an organization’s financial health. Reviewing both <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-operating-margin">operating</a> and <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-profit-margin">profit margin</a>, which take more than COGS into account, provides a more comprehensive understanding into how well a company is running.</p>

				<p>Did you know that the average restaurant has a profit margin of just 7%? That means for every $100 in sales, the restaurant only earns around $7 in profit. As a restaurant CEO or CFO, it&#8217;s important to understand what affects your profit margin and how you can improve it. In this guide, we&#8217;ll explore the factors that influence restaurant profit margins and offer tips on how to increase profitability. We&#8217;ll also look at profitability by geography, category, and franchising level. So whether you&#8217;re looking to boost your restaurant&#8217;s bottom line or just want to better understand how it works, read on for insight into restaurant profit margins!</p><h2><strong>How Do You Calculate a Restaurant&#8217;s Profit Margin Percentage?</strong></h2><p>How profitable are the most successful restaurant operations? The answer to that question will change based on the margins used to measure the organization’s performance. Here, we examine four metrics that investors and managers use to gauge a foodservice operation’s profitability: gross margin, operating margin, and profit margin.</p><h3><strong>How to Calculate Gross Margins for Foodservice</strong></h3><p><a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-gross-margin">Gross margin</a> reflects what percentage of revenue a restaurant operation keeps after paying for the costs of the products or services it sells. The higher ratio, the better, indicating a lower cost of goods sold (COGS), which includes any expenditure directly necessary for producing the items on a restaurant’s menu.</p><p>The ratio is calculated using the following expression:</p><p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-21979 size-medium" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Gross-Profit-Margin-300x65.jpg" alt="Gross Profit Margin equals Gross Profit Divided by Total Sales Revenue" width="300" height="65" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Gross-Profit-Margin-300x65.jpg 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Gross-Profit-Margin-768x167.jpg 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Gross-Profit-Margin.jpg 936w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p><p>The average restaurant profit measured by the Gross Margin is 45% (considering publicly traded restaurants in the U.S.)</p><h3><strong>How to Calculate a Restaurant Operating Profitability</strong></h3><p><a href="https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/accounting/operating-margin/">Operating profit</a> margin indicates what percentage of revenue remains after all operating costs have been deducted, including COGS, selling, general, and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses, and others. That is, operating profit includes more costs than gross profit, because it takes into account line items like marketing, managerial salaries, and other expenses not directly related to production.</p><p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-21981 size-medium aligncenter" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Operating-Profit-Margin-300x64.jpg" alt="Operating profit margin equals operating profit divided by total sales revenue" width="300" height="64" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Operating-Profit-Margin-300x64.jpg 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Operating-Profit-Margin-768x164.jpg 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Operating-Profit-Margin.jpg 936w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p><h3><strong>How to Calculate a Restaurant EBITDA</strong></h3><p>The restaurant industry can be mighty unforgiving because of thin margins and high operating expenses. <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebitda.asp">EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization)</a> plays a crucial role, as it is designed to help owners and operators place a firm value on their restaurant company’s earning power by focusing on cash flow.</p><p><strong>EBITDA</strong> is characterized as net cash income, or net operating income. To calculate EBITDA, restaurant owners must subtract their fixed costs from their gross profit. (EBITDA does not reflect noncash expenses such as depreciation and interest payments.) <strong>Operating profit</strong>, on the other hand, is calculated by subtracting the costs of goods sold, plus expenses, from total sales. Many operators and owners view restaurant EBITDA as a useful way of evaluating the actual earnings power of their operation, and to compare their businesses to others carrying different debt levels or depreciation values.</p><p>EBITDA  is a very useful metric to measure corporate profitability and is a good tool for comparing companies, especially within the same industry as it excludes financial effects and capital expenditures.</p><p>It is calculated as follows:</p><p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-21982 size-large" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Ebitda-Definition-1024x67.jpg" alt="EBITDA equals Net Income plus Interest plus Taxes plus Depreciation plus Amortization" width="640" height="42" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Ebitda-Definition-1024x67.jpg 1024w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Ebitda-Definition-300x20.jpg 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Ebitda-Definition-768x50.jpg 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Ebitda-Definition.jpg 1100w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p><p>Careful though! EBITDA essentially neutralizes the cost of debt and adds back income taxes to the net income. Therefore, companies tend to highlight their EBITDA when performance is still very impressive. In fact, a company with a negative net income may have a positive EBITDA.</p><p>The typical restaurant profitability is 12% (EBITDA margin for publicly traded foodservice companies in the U.S.). The top-quartile (the best performers) is passing the 18% profitability margin. And while many of those are highly-franchised companies, most of the best performers are those able to harness headwinds and turn challenges into opportunities. On the other hand, the bottom-quartile (the worst performers) has a profitability (measured by the EBITDA margin) of only 5%.</p><p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-21983 size-large" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/US-Restaurant-Profitability-1024x679.png" alt="Bar chart EBITDA margin for close to 50 restaurant chains" width="640" height="424" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/US-Restaurant-Profitability-1024x679.png 1024w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/US-Restaurant-Profitability-300x199.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/US-Restaurant-Profitability-768x509.png 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/US-Restaurant-Profitability-1536x1018.png 1536w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/US-Restaurant-Profitability-1568x1039.png 1568w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/US-Restaurant-Profitability.png 1820w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p><h3><strong>How to Calculate the Net Profit Margin for a Restaurant </strong></h3><p>The <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profitmargin.asp">net profit margin</a> ratio includes every expense an organization pays out before calculating the percentage of each revenue dollar it gets to keep.

				<h2><strong>What Affects a Restaurant Profit Margin?</strong></h2><p>Some of the factors affecting the profitability level of a restaurant are the geography, the type of ownership (if it’s a franchisor, or if most of the locations are corporately owned, or if it’s a franchisee), the size (is it a big chain with hundreds of units or is it a small one with a couple dozens or an independent restaurant with one or two stores?), and the category (is it a quick-service restaurant chain or fast casual or casual dining?).</p><ul><li>Restaurant profit margins (measured by EBITDA as a percentage of sales) tend to stabilize around 12% independently of the geography — with a few exceptions.</li><li>Restaurant profitability is higher for franchised systems. Foodservice companies with highly franchised systems almost triple the profitability of those with lightly franchised systems (or not franchising at all).</li><li>Highly franchised QSR systems tend to be the most profitable, followed by highly franchised fast casual, and highly franchised casual dining.</li></ul><h2><strong>The Average Restaurant Profit Margin is Higher in Some Emerging Markets</strong></h2><p>The median restaurant profit margin is 12% in the U.S., 13% in Europe including the UK (measured by the EBITDA margins of public foodservice companies). In some markets it can be significantly lower, like Japan, with an EBITDA margin of only 3%. In emerging markets like India, the median is not very different from mature markets (close to 12%). In emerging markets like the KSA, Mexico and the Philippines, the median restaurant EBITDA margin reaches 17%.</p><p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-21985 size-large" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Global-Restaurant-Margins-1024x678.jpg" alt="Box plot for EBITDA margin for six regions" width="640" height="424" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Global-Restaurant-Margins-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Global-Restaurant-Margins-300x199.jpg 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Global-Restaurant-Margins-768x509.jpg 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Global-Restaurant-Margins.jpg 1214w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>					</div>

Restaurant franchisors grant rights, territory rights, and share systems with franchisees and in exchange they receive a percentage of the franchisee sales (and other fees such as marketing fees).</p><p>Restaurant chains with highly franchised systems (we consider companies with more than two-thirds of their systems franchised) have a profitability of close to 25% whereas those with lightly franchised systems (less than a third of the system franchised, or even 100% corporate ownerships) have margins close to 8% of revenue. These stats are based on U.S. publicly traded companies.</p><p><strong><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-21986 size-large" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Restaurant-Franchising-Margins-1024x678.jpg" alt="bar chart with ebitda margin for highly and lightly franchised restaurant chains" width="640" height="424" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Restaurant-Franchising-Margins-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Restaurant-Franchising-Margins-300x199.jpg 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Restaurant-Franchising-Margins-768x509.jpg 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Restaurant-Franchising-Margins-1536x1017.jpg 1536w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Restaurant-Franchising-Margins-1568x1038.jpg 1568w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Restaurant-Franchising-Margins.jpg 1818w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></strong></p><h2><strong>What are the Most Profitable Restaurants?</strong></h2><p>Highly franchised QSR systems have the highest profitability margins in the restaurant industry (based on publicly traded U.S. companies). Highly franchised Fast Casual comes next, and highly franchised Casual Dining after. All the lightly franchised categories (QSR, Fast Casual, and Casual Dining) come after.</p><p>In particular, McDonald’s is the most profitable restaurant (considering U.S. public companies) with close to 50% EBITDA margins as of mid-2022, followed by Restaurant Brands International (parent of Burger King, Tim Horton’s, Popeye’s and Firehouse Subs) with a profit margin of 35%.</p><p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-21987 size-large" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Most-profitable-restaurants-1024x677.jpg" alt="grouped bar chart for ebitda margin for casual dining, fast casual, and QSR" width="640" height="423" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Most-profitable-restaurants-1024x677.jpg 1024w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Most-profitable-restaurants-300x198.jpg 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Most-profitable-restaurants-768x507.jpg 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Most-profitable-restaurants-1536x1015.jpg 1536w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Most-profitable-restaurants-1568x1036.jpg 1568w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Most-profitable-restaurants.jpg 1816w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p><h2><strong>How Has Restaurant Profitability Changed Over Time?</strong></h2><p>The median EBITDA margin for restaurants remained stable between 2017 and 2021. In 2017, U.S. public restaurants had a median profitability of 14% and this number reached 15% in 2021.</p><p>The companies that increased profitability the most were Rave Restaurant Group (going from negative 7% to positive 22% and Yum! China from 17% to 34% EBITDA margin. However, close to two-thirds of the companies were worse off in 2021 than in 2017, with profitability dropping between a few points to between 15 and 17 percentage points.</p><h2><strong>Strategies to Improve Your Restaurant Profit Margin</strong></h2><p>When margins shrink, executive teams can be tempted to slash costs to the bone, but such decisions are self-defeating. Here are a few techniques to improve margins:</p><h3><strong>1 – Do a Brand Audit</strong></h3><p>A comprehensive <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-brand-audit">brand audit</a> can identify areas of opportunity for organizations across all functional areas, rather than simply focusing on ways to decrease expenses. This can result in strategies proven to boost revenue and streamline operations, both of which produce long-term and sustainable growth, regardless of market conditions.</p><h3><strong>2 – Simplify Your Menu </strong></h3><p>Concepts with <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/menu-strategy">focused menus</a> perform better than those that offer a lot of options that complicate the back-of-house and require additional labor. Price optimization should be part of any menu engineering project. After studying items profitability and how the guests are making their decisions, management will be in a good position to define promoting certain items or removing some.</p><h3><strong>3 – Be Intentional About the Menu Layout</strong></h3><p>Menu engineering is part science (we like to take the facts from the transactional data) and part art. <a href="https://aaronallen.com/menu-design">The menu layout</a> (for written menus, for digital menus, drive-thru menus) will emphasize the most profitable items. Menu Engineering can increase profits by 20%.</p><h3><strong>4 – Train Your Stuff Properly</strong></h3><p>It may be counter-intuitive to assign extra dollars to training when you’re trying to improve profits but when employees are excited, it spills over to customers.</p><h3><strong>5 – Don’t “Just” Do Marketing, Think of PR Too</strong></h3><p>PR is often an overlooked element of marketing. While word of mouth is always good, positive public awareness is better built by a <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/the-value-of-restaurant-public-relations">PR campaign</a> leveraging media relationships, generating implied endorsements, and creating a story around the restaurant to generate brand recognition and buzz.</p><h3><strong>6 – Streamline the Front and Back-of-House</strong></h3><p>When your restaurant is running smoothly, everyone benefits. You can speed up table turnover and serve more customers per service by equipping FOH and BOH staff with tools that will help them work smarter, you can push specials that the kitchen is able to produce effectively, and you can incorporate technology like self-ordering and self-pay that will allow time-conscious guests to move quickly through the lines.</p><h3><strong>7 – Monitor the Right KPIs</strong></h3><p>If you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it. Are you able to track the most important KPIs in real time? Do you know your restaurant and kitchen capacity? Can you tell in real time if you are gonna be under- or over-staffed in the next hours? Knowing what your team can do and what’s happening with customers as well as what are the high-level metrics can help you solve problems sooner rather than waiting to the end of month to see where your margins are.</p><h3><strong>8 – Use Technology to Schedule Labor</strong></h3><p>The key to having a properly staffed restaurant is streamlining your staff&#8217;s schedules. It may seem like an easy task, but it’s not unusual for things to slip through the cracks when it comes down to managing employees. Several tools allow to schedule staff smartly, even allowing them to exchange shifts without a manager intervening.</p><h3><strong>9 – Make Sure Your Marketing Is Generating a Strong Presence Online</strong></h3><p>Remember to list your business in Google, update hours, addresses, menus, and other relevant information, make it easy to order online, partner with reservation platforms. It’s important to also actively manage and frequently update the restaurant social media presence (if people can only see old posts they will wonder if you are still open), including TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter (at the least).</p><h3><strong>10 – Be Effective with the Use of Ingredients</strong></h3><p>Managing inventory and forecasting demand are great tools to reduce food waste. With food being around a third of a restaurant&#8217;s expenses, this can’t go under-scored.</p><h3><strong>11 – Grow the Top Line</strong></h3><p>We always say that top-line growth can cure any bottom-line ailments. Bringing guests back more often (guest experience, loyalty, menu innovation), bringing new guests (marketing and advertising, promotional activity), trying to improve the average check size (for example add-ons, sizes, shareables), and improving sales channels (delivery and off-premise) and product lines (are you catering to vegetarians? Should you offer merchandizing?) all need adequate attention.</p>					</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How profitable are the most successful restaurant operations? The answer to that question will change based on the margins used to measure the organization’s performance. In this series, we examine three metrics that investors and managers use to gauge a foodservice operation’s profitability: gross margin, operating margin, and profit margin.</p>
<h2>How to Calculate Restaurant Profitability Margins</h2>
<p>Each margin calculates the relationship between a company’s revenue and its liabilities, from labor and food costs to administrative expenses and debt payments.</p>
<p><a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-gross-margin">Gross margin</a> reflects what percentage of revenue a restaurant operation keeps after paying for the costs of the products or services it sells. The higher ratio, the better, indicating a lower cost of goods sold (COGS), which includes any expenditure directly necessary for producing the items on a restaurant’s menu.</p>
<p>The ratio is calculated using the following expression:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10985" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Restaurant-Profitability-Gross-Profit-Margin-Equation.png" alt="Restaurant Profitability Gross Margin Equation" width="560" height="121" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Restaurant-Profitability-Gross-Profit-Margin-Equation.png 560w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Restaurant-Profitability-Gross-Profit-Margin-Equation-350x76.png 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Restaurant-Profitability-Gross-Profit-Margin-Equation-300x65.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Restaurant-Profitability-Gross-Profit-Margin-Equation-500x108.png 500w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Restaurant-Profitability-Gross-Profit-Margin-Equation-220x48.png 220w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Restaurant-Profitability-Gross-Profit-Margin-Equation-160x35.png 160w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-operating-margin">Operating profit</a> margin indicates what percentage of revenue remains after all operating costs have been deducted, including COGS, selling, general, and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses, and others. That is, operating profit includes more costs than gross profit, because it takes into account line items like marketing, managerial salaries, and other expenses not directly related to production.</p>
<p><a href="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Restaurant-Profitability-Operating-Margin-Equation.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-10987 size-full" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Restaurant-Profitability-Operating-Margin-Equation.png" alt="Restaurant Profitability Operating Margin Equation" width="640" height="136" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Restaurant-Profitability-Operating-Margin-Equation.png 640w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Restaurant-Profitability-Operating-Margin-Equation-350x74.png 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Restaurant-Profitability-Operating-Margin-Equation-300x64.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Restaurant-Profitability-Operating-Margin-Equation-500x106.png 500w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Restaurant-Profitability-Operating-Margin-Equation-220x47.png 220w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Restaurant-Profitability-Operating-Margin-Equation-160x34.png 160w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-profit-margin">net profit margin</a> ratio includes every expense an organization pays out before calculating the percentage of each revenue dollar it gets to keep. It also considers other sources of revenue besides sales, like interest income.</p>
<p>While gross and operating margins are entirely under the company’s control, net profit considers line items including taxes, depreciation, debt payments, and extraordinary items.</p>
<p>It is calculated as follows:</p>
<p><a href="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Restaurant-Profitability-Net-Profit-Margin-Equation.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-10986 size-full" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Restaurant-Profitability-Net-Profit-Margin-Equation.png" alt="Restaurant Profitability Net Profit Margin Equation" width="514" height="123" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Restaurant-Profitability-Net-Profit-Margin-Equation.png 514w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Restaurant-Profitability-Net-Profit-Margin-Equation-350x84.png 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Restaurant-Profitability-Net-Profit-Margin-Equation-300x72.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Restaurant-Profitability-Net-Profit-Margin-Equation-500x120.png 500w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Restaurant-Profitability-Net-Profit-Margin-Equation-220x53.png 220w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Restaurant-Profitability-Net-Profit-Margin-Equation-160x38.png 160w" sizes="(max-width: 514px) 100vw, 514px" /></a></p>
<p>These equations give management teams and potential investors different ways of slicing through the operation’s performance to help discover where costs may be excessive relative to performance.</p>
<h2>Simple Menus and Streamlined Operations Key to High Margins</h2>
<p>From a comparison of public companies, Dunkin’ Brands came in first for all three margins, owing not only to the recent decision to simplify its menu and refocus on the breakfast segment, but also to the coffee-and-donut giant’s 100% <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/franchise-restaurant-earnings-per-share">franchise rate</a>, which stabilizes costs for the parent company.</p>
<p>Across margin calculations and segments, concepts with focused menus performed better than those that offered a lot of options. Highly franchised chains have operating margins about 5.5x the industry median.</p>
<p>Though these margins are by no means definitive, they are useful metrics for comparison, helping executives and investors see how other operations in their space perform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A public restaurant company’s current stock price can tell you a lot about its past and current performance, but it doesn’t offer much insight into the future. Chipotle’s investors would have probably loved some warning signs before the food safety scandal that <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/schultz-johnson-show-profits-follow-purpose-aaron-d-allen/">cut the chain’s value</a> in half. Though they aren’t perfect crystal balls, an organization’s <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/franchise-restaurant-earnings-per-share">earnings per share</a> (EPS) and dividends per share (DPS) say a lot about the executive team’s priorities, helping investors make educated decisions about where to put their money.</p>
<p>Before we get into the numbers, some quick definitions. EPS is calculated by subtracting dividends distributed from net profit and then dividing that figure by the average number of shares outstanding. As result, the lower the number of outstanding shares, the higher EPS — which explains why <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/stock-buybacks-dividend-distributions">buybacks</a> can increase EPS.</p>
<p>DPS measures the portion of a restaurant company’s earnings that it distributes to shareholders. While some investors see consistent payouts as a signal of the company’s strong performance, a high DPS might indicate that the firm is not reinvesting capital, possibly due to few positive NPV projects or growth investment opportunities. Companies with expected low growth rates often pay out high DPS rates.</p>
<p>Looking at the difference rates of EPS and DPS, not to mention the ratio between the two figures, tells us quite a bit not only about individual foodservice companies but also about the industry landscape as a whole.</p>
<h2>Restaurants Show a Large Swing in EPS</h2>
<p>Public restaurant companies in the top quartile have an EPS of at least $2.49, 2.5 times the industry median.</p>
<p><a href="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurant-Earnings-Per-Share-1.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-10968 size-large" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurant-Earnings-Per-Share-1-1024x680.png" alt="Restaurant Earnings Per Share" width="980" height="651" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurant-Earnings-Per-Share-1-1024x680.png 1024w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurant-Earnings-Per-Share-1-350x232.png 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurant-Earnings-Per-Share-1-300x199.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurant-Earnings-Per-Share-1-768x510.png 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurant-Earnings-Per-Share-1-970x644.png 970w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurant-Earnings-Per-Share-1-500x332.png 500w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurant-Earnings-Per-Share-1-640x425.png 640w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurant-Earnings-Per-Share-1-187x124.png 187w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurant-Earnings-Per-Share-1-136x90.png 136w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurant-Earnings-Per-Share-1.png 1638w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px" /></a></p>
<p>The gap between the highest EPS in the industry and the second highest value is striking. Biglari Holdings had an EPS of $40.80 in 2017, 41 times the industry median. Second-place Cracker Barrel earned $8.40 for each outstanding share of stock outstanding.</p>
<p>Bilgari Holding’s high EPS can be explained by its small number of outstanding­ shares. As of December 31, 2017, Sardar Biglari held approximately 52.6% of the company’s stocks leaving only 2.1m shares outstanding, the lowest among peer companies. In comparison, Cracker Barrel has 24.3m shares, and McDonald’s allocates its earnings to 807.4m outstanding shares.</p>
<p>On the other side, Dine Brands reported an EPS of -$18.28, attributable to -$330.54m earnings in 2017, with a total revenue of $804.8m. The decline was primarily due to lower revenue from Applebee’s, which cut into the gross profit from franchise operations. An increase in bad debt expenses and growing G&amp;A expenses due to labor-related costs also contributed to the loss.</p>
<p>Interestingly, both Biglari Holdings and Dine Brands are casual-dining restaurants, implying a swing of $59.08 not only in the industry as a whole but specifically within the casual dining segment.</p>

<p>Compared to other industries, foodservice has a moderate swing. Finance &amp; insurance has the highest, at $259.06/share. Many industries, such as healthcare, education services, and oil &amp; energy have a negative median EPS. Foodservice ranks third in median EPS, only surpassed by construction and finance &amp; insurance.</p>
<h2>Fast Casuals Not Distributing Dividends</h2>
<p>More than half of U.S. publicly traded foodservice companies don’t pay dividends to shareholders. The top quartile for all operations is $0.81 or greater. While the ratio of casual-dining and quick-service companies paying dividends is similar to the distribution across the industry, fast-casual restaurants are under-represented. The share of fast casuals paying dividends is 5%, but this segment accounts for about a fifth of the foodservice companies on the stock exchange. Only 34% of fast casuals have positive EPS, and, of those, only Wingstop paid dividends in 2017.</p>
<p>Likewise, no upscale restaurants appear in this group, likely because their 0% franchise rate means they have more substantial CAPEX requirements than QSR or CDR chains. Most restaurants in this category prioritize reinvestment into new store openings, maintenance, and remodeling.</p>

<p>Foodservice has a low median DPS when compared to other industries. Finance &amp; insurance once again has the highest swing, at $50/share — 10.75 times foodservice’s $4.65 swing. The utilities industry has the highest DPS median ($1.26). This is more evidence that  companies with lower growth prospects distribute higher dividends: stocks in utility companies are relatively stable and have fewer opportunities for earnings growth beyond inflation.</p>
<h2>Dividend Cuts Can Spook Markets</h2>
<p>It’s quite surprising that Dine Brands continued to pay dividends despite a negative EPS, but some organizations maintain their payouts no matter what because markets can react negatively to reduced or eliminated dividends, leading to a drop in the company’s share price.</p>

<p>Even some established chains may prefer to reinvest their earnings rather than issue dividends. These retained earnings are used for CAPEX investments, concept acquisitions, and as a cushion to protect the operation from future losses or extraordinary events.</p>
<p>An executive team’s decisions about whether to distribute or reinvest their earnings will come down to their overall strategy, but operators should consider the signals these decisions are sending to investors. It’s true that regular, high dividends will attract investors, as long the payouts do not compromise long-term growth and success. The stock market runs on perceptions — and everything from a restaurant’s interior design and logo to its EPS and DPS figures contribute to current and potential investors’ opinion of the operation.</p>
