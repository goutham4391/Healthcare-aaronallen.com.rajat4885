				<p>Restaurant venture capital is starting to take on a new meaning. While it may refer to the early financing of a restaurant (or chain), more recent trends and activity have evolved to the term being primarily focused on foodservice technology investments. </p><p>We are currently in the bronze age of restaurant technology, and the golden age is about to come. To participate in big <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-valuation-multiples" target="_blank" rel="noopener">valuation wins</a>, investors have to get in early. In many cases, the revenue and EV acceleration will be like going from 0–60 mph in less than 2.4 seconds (many won’t believe this could happen and will therefore miss the opportunity).</p><p>Some key takeaways: </p><ul><li>Venture capital broke new records during the pandemic (across industries)</li><li>U.S. VC deal value grew almost five times in the last ten years to more than $150 billion</li><li>There are plenty of opportunities for VC investors in foodservice tech, and the upside can be realized quickly</li><li>A sample of foodservice tech companies indicates an average enterprise value growth of $455 million per funding round</li><li>The highest Enterprise Value to Revenue ratio we recorded was not for food delivery companies but for other types of foodservice tech (considering a sample of recent transactions)</li></ul><p>While <a href="https://www.qsrmagazine.com/restaurant-operations/restaurants-brace-flood-investment-money">private equity capital is pouring</a> into the usual choices and boosting valuation for restaurants and more traditional foodservice tech, there’s a lot of new market development within foodservice tech that benefits from VC funding.</p><h2>Venture Capital Not Taking a Break During the Pandemic</h2><p>The M&amp;A activity halt at the onset of the pandemic resulted in many VCs reallocating attention and resources to ventures already in their portfolios — rather than sourcing new deals. This resulted in record numbers for both fundraising and deal value. VC activity in the U.S. reached $156B in 2020 (across all sectors), and there’s a similar amount in dry powder expected to be deployed in 2021.</p><p>VCs are backing <a href="https://aaronallen.com/restaurant-technology">foodservice technology</a> and seeing a wide range of returns. Decisions regarding where to invest today should not be based on what others wanted yesterday or can prove today, it&#8217;s much more about predicting what will happen in the tomorrows ahead. It’s also about having the right team in place that can make that vision a reality and is able to bridge the gap between tech developers and restaurant operators.</p><h3>How Are Valuations Responding to Increased Venture Capital Activity?</h3><p>Across industries, valuations of VC-backed startups are growing at a record pace. In the third quarter of 2021, the YOY median pre-money valuation growth reached 77% (a level not seen in at least ten years).</p><p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-20742 size-full" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Venture-Capital-Valuations.png" alt="restaurant venture capital valuations" width="1816" height="1204" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Venture-Capital-Valuations.png 1816w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Venture-Capital-Valuations-300x199.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Venture-Capital-Valuations-1024x679.png 1024w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Venture-Capital-Valuations-768x509.png 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Venture-Capital-Valuations-1536x1018.png 1536w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Venture-Capital-Valuations-1568x1040.png 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1816px) 100vw, 1816px" /></p><p>Investors are moving to earlier-stage companies and boosting valuations.</p><h3>Who Are the Most Valuable VC-Backed Companies?</h3><p>The 20 most valuable VC-backed companies in the U.S. are worth close to $400 billion. Their distribution across segments can be taken as a proxy (and inspiration) for what technologies are going to have an impact in the foodservice industry over the next few years.</p><p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-20744 size-full" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Top-20-VC-Backed-Companies-United-States.png" alt="most valuable VC-backed companies" width="3232" height="2140" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Top-20-VC-Backed-Companies-United-States.png 2560w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Top-20-VC-Backed-Companies-United-States-300x199.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Top-20-VC-Backed-Companies-United-States-1024x678.png 1024w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Top-20-VC-Backed-Companies-United-States-768x509.png 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Top-20-VC-Backed-Companies-United-States-1536x1017.png 1536w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Top-20-VC-Backed-Companies-United-States-2048x1356.png 2048w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Top-20-VC-Backed-Companies-United-States-1568x1038.png 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 3232px) 100vw, 3232px" /></p><p>While Online Payment Processing and Blockchain companies take the largest share (representing close to a third of the value), Advanced Analytics, Autonomous Vehicles, AI, Automation, IoT, and Sensors account for 20% of the value of the top 20.</p><h3>Corporate Venture Capital Is Also in the Race</h3><p>As venture capital has increased in popularity over the past several years, corporations have also gotten in on the game. Global CVC activity has grown at a 22% CAGR over the last four years — in comparison, M&amp;A has been relatively stable at around $3.2 trillion.</p><p>While <a href="https://www.thedeal.com/mergers-acquisitions/restaurant-dealmaking-makes-comeback/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">M&amp;A enables companies</a> to access new markets or new products and typically involves companies with a certain trajectory, CVC has more to do with R&amp;D and long-term opportunities with attractive potential.</p><p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-20745 size-full" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Corporate-Venture-Capital-Growth.png" alt="" width="3232" height="2146" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Corporate-Venture-Capital-Growth.png 2560w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Corporate-Venture-Capital-Growth-300x199.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Corporate-Venture-Capital-Growth-1024x680.png 1024w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Corporate-Venture-Capital-Growth-768x510.png 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Corporate-Venture-Capital-Growth-1536x1020.png 1536w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Corporate-Venture-Capital-Growth-2048x1360.png 2048w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Corporate-Venture-Capital-Growth-1568x1041.png 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 3232px) 100vw, 3232px" /></p><p>There are many merits to building a corporate venture capital group, and it’s not just generating future financial returns. The right CVC investment can unlock new layers of growth, open channel expansion opportunities, or drive improved systemwide efficiencies through new technologies.</p><h2>Venture Capital in Foodservice Technology</h2><p>The <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/investing-in-restaurants" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opportunities in foodservice technology</a> for Venture Capital investments are plenty. Some of these have the potential to grow in valuation at an outstanding pace while solving some of the industry’s most pervasive problems and even helping from a point of view of sustainability.</p><p>Those who are ahead are motivated by a combination of both profits and purpose.</p><h3>Investing in Early-Stage Foodservice Tech</h3><p>We reviewed a sample of foodservice tech companies (including categories like delivery, POS, robotics, SaaS, and more) and calculated that on average, enterprise value grows $455 million per funding round (from Seed Round and Series A onwards). Investors getting in early can see huge valuation growth.</p><p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-20747 size-full" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Foodservice-Tech-Valuations.png" alt="" width="3228" height="2140" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Foodservice-Tech-Valuations.png 2560w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Foodservice-Tech-Valuations-300x199.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Foodservice-Tech-Valuations-1024x679.png 1024w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Foodservice-Tech-Valuations-768x509.png 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Foodservice-Tech-Valuations-1536x1018.png 1536w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Foodservice-Tech-Valuations-2048x1358.png 2048w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Foodservice-Tech-Valuations-1568x1040.png 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 3228px) 100vw, 3228px" /></p><p>This enterprise value growth is backed by revenue (or an Annual Recurring Rate) growth of about $23 million per round. In many cases, what these companies require to jump to the next level are <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-advisor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">industry expertise</a> to attune the global go-to-market strategy, product iteration, and market/industry positioning.</p><p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-20746 size-full" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Restaurant-Venture-Capital-Early-Stage-Revenue-Growth.jpg" alt="early stage foodservice tech" width="636" height="416" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Restaurant-Venture-Capital-Early-Stage-Revenue-Growth.jpg 636w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Restaurant-Venture-Capital-Early-Stage-Revenue-Growth-300x196.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 636px) 100vw, 636px" /></p><h3>Recent Restaurant and Foodservice Tech Valuations and Growth</h3><p>When looking at the value of foodservice tech, it’s mostly delivery or POS companies. But as emerging categories start to come out of pilots and into a go-to-market phase, the landscape is starting to change.</p><p>We compiled the enterprise value of some of the most recent foodservice tech companies that have been through acquisitions, fundraising, are close to an IPO, or are publicly traded. Though the billion-dollar mark had mostly been for food delivery companies so far, we’re seeing more and more other foodservice tech passing this valuation.</p><p>Some of the capabilities of AI, automation, robotics, advanced analytics, and other technologies are closing in on the point when massive adoption starts. The best opportunities for investors are only on the radar of a handful of qualified industry experts right now.</p><p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-20748 size-full" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Foodservice-Tech-Enterprise-Value.png" alt="" width="1820" height="1204" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Foodservice-Tech-Enterprise-Value.png 1820w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Foodservice-Tech-Enterprise-Value-300x198.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Foodservice-Tech-Enterprise-Value-1024x677.png 1024w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Foodservice-Tech-Enterprise-Value-768x508.png 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Foodservice-Tech-Enterprise-Value-1536x1016.png 1536w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Foodservice-Tech-Enterprise-Value-1568x1037.png 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1820px) 100vw, 1820px" /></p><p>Growing more than $1 billion in EV per year: delivery companies Delivery Hero and Wolt, Cloud Kitchens, and Toast (with a $20b+ IPO). Several other foodservice tech companies have been in a range from $8 million per year to $800+.</p><p>Some tech companies will jump to very high valuations, the key is to identify which ones have the flexibility to adapt to what restaurant operations need and want.</p><p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-20749 size-full" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Investing-in-Foodservice-Tech.png" alt="" width="1814" height="1202" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Investing-in-Foodservice-Tech.png 1814w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Investing-in-Foodservice-Tech-300x199.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Investing-in-Foodservice-Tech-1024x679.png 1024w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Investing-in-Foodservice-Tech-768x509.png 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Investing-in-Foodservice-Tech-1536x1018.png 1536w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Investing-in-Foodservice-Tech-1568x1039.png 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1814px) 100vw, 1814px" /></p><p>The highest Enterprise Value to Revenue ratio we recorded was not for food delivery companies but for other types of foodservice tech (climbing to outsized valuations because of their low revenue). This may not surprise a tech investor, but it’s not common for food (even foodservice tech) investors, who are not seizing many opportunities that seem “too good to be true”. There are many applications of foodservice tech that restaurant chains are ready to implement but investors are unwilling to finance. There’s a lot of “you go first” mentality — and seasoned groups that come with industry expertise will be able to separate the wheat from the chaff.</p><p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-20750 size-full" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Foodservice-Technology-Valuations.png" alt="" width="1814" height="1202" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Foodservice-Technology-Valuations.png 1814w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Foodservice-Technology-Valuations-300x199.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Foodservice-Technology-Valuations-1024x679.png 1024w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Foodservice-Technology-Valuations-768x509.png 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Foodservice-Technology-Valuations-1536x1018.png 1536w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Foodservice-Technology-Valuations-1568x1039.png 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1814px) 100vw, 1814px" /></p><h2>Restaurant Technology Case Studies Showing a Path for VC</h2><p>Industry expertise is necessary to find the gems with the best shot at becoming the most valuable foodservice tech in the world. As with most start-ups, the following case studies started with a friends-and-family round, followed by venture capital funding. We are pointing out a few of the factors that helped these companies grow to become some of the most successful in their industries.</p><h3>Grubhub Shows Enterprise Growth Gaining Traction with Number of Subscribers</h3><p>Food delivery aggregators constitute a case study for all foodservice tech companies in terms of a correlation between market penetration and valuation. Delivery was a land grab, and Grubhub understood this very well.</p><p>Grubhub’s client base grew by 650% from 2015-2019, and a 318% growth in enterprise value followed. In practical terms, for every restaurant subscribed the company got $24,000 in EV when they were acquired by Just Eat/Takeaway in June 2020.</p><p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-20792 size-full" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Grubhub-Customer-Base-Value.jpg" alt="" width="1622" height="1075" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Grubhub-Customer-Base-Value.jpg 1622w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Grubhub-Customer-Base-Value-300x199.jpg 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Grubhub-Customer-Base-Value-1024x679.jpg 1024w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Grubhub-Customer-Base-Value-768x509.jpg 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Grubhub-Customer-Base-Value-1536x1018.jpg 1536w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Grubhub-Customer-Base-Value-1568x1039.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1622px) 100vw, 1622px" /></p><p>There are many early-stage foodservice tech companies that could be a solid deal, with a strong team, product, and company/category with incredible market potential. They often need the help of industry experts to get more exposure and traction (from product iterations to positioning to locking key accounts).</p><h3>Instacart Shows the Valuation Step Ups Foodservice Tech May Also Reach</h3><p>Instacart is not a foodservice technology company, but it’s an interesting adjacent case study. The company’s enterprise value has grown at an average of 249% between rounds (meaning the value multiplied by 1,560 times in 8 years). During the March 2021 funding round, the EV doubled (more than impressive when considering this is in the billions of dollars).</p><p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-20794 size-full" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Instacart-Valuation-Stepup.jpg" alt="" width="1621" height="1076" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Instacart-Valuation-Stepup.jpg 1621w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Instacart-Valuation-Stepup-300x199.jpg 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Instacart-Valuation-Stepup-1024x680.jpg 1024w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Instacart-Valuation-Stepup-768x510.jpg 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Instacart-Valuation-Stepup-1536x1020.jpg 1536w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Instacart-Valuation-Stepup-1568x1041.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1621px) 100vw, 1621px" /></p><p>However, the valuation step-ups of the initial funding rounds also show how investors can benefit at the early stages. The valuation step-up in early 2014 was 15.2x (from $25M to $380M) and 5.2x in late 2014 (from $380M to $1.96B). Valuation step-ups stabilized at around 1.5x after that (until the 2.2x jump in the last round of March 2021).</p>					</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While we expect M&amp;A activity to continue to pick up over the next five years, those leveraging the best insights regarding the evolution of the market landscape to inform a modernized and globally-oriented F&amp;B investment thesis are set to lead (and even create) segments and categories.</p>
<p>There’s plenty of capital to put behind foodservice companies, and some that are not even in the radar right now (like those looking to <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/alternative-foodservice-formats">alternative formats</a> and improved unit economic models as well as <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-innovation">transformative technologies</a>) will jump to very large valuations in the next few years.</p>
<p>Here are ten of the most popular pieces we&#8217;ve shared, all informed by our experience supporting both operators and investors in the foodservice and hospitality sectors.</p>
<p><a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-ma-2018"><br />
<img loading="lazy" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/restaurant-ma-2018.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/restaurant-ma-2018.jpg 1314w, https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/restaurant-ma-2018-300x99-1.jpg 300w, https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/restaurant-ma-2018-768x254-1.jpg 768w, https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/restaurant-ma-2018-1024x338-1.jpg 1024w" alt="restaurant m&amp;a 2018" width="1314" height="434" /> </a></p>
<p>Strategic levers for restaurant M&amp;A are not necessarily new, but understanding the evolving landscape enables non-traditional value-creation opportunities. When the right components are combined within a platform, the whole can be much greater than the sum of its parts (and this is reflected in valuations). <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-ma-2018">Read More</a></p>
<p>As Private Equity activity continues to flourish in the foodservice sector, restaurant valuation multiples have followed suit — rising even when deal volumes drop. Premiums for high-quality targets are on the rise, with valuations reaching their highest multiple (11.1x) since 2007. <a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-valuation-multiples">Read More</a></p>
<p>Whether to achieve consistent top-line growth, expand market share, enter fast-growing new markets, add new capabilities, remain current with shifting consumer demands, or integrate value-enhancing technologies, acquisitions make strategic sense in this era of cheap capital, fierce competition, and moderated growth. <a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-mergers-and-acquisitions">Read More</a></p>
<p><a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/stock-buybacks-dividend-distributions"><img loading="lazy" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/stock-buybacks.jpg" alt="stock buybacks" width="1314" height="434" /></a></p>
<p>A number of the largest and best-known publicly traded foodservice companies in the U.S. are choosing buybacks and dividend increases over investing in their existing locations, opening new units, or acquiring new concepts. <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/stock-buybacks-dividend-distributions">Read More</a></p>
<p><a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-commercial-due-diligence-private-equity"><img loading="lazy" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/restaurant-due-diligence-findings.png" alt="restaurant due diligence findings" width="1314" height="434" /></a></p>
<p>While those in the financial and banking sectors often perform the due diligence on those deals, a firm with extensive restaurant experience and a deep knowledge base can deliver insights based on operational and commerical audits that might otherwise be passed over by a generalist advisor. <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-commercial-due-diligence-private-equity">Read More</a></p>
<p>As deal size has almost doubled across North America and Europe over the last decade, we’re seeing more consolidation as portfolios are making a number of different-sized acquisitions quickly, and convenience and tech both continue to be hot trends for foodservice-related investments.  <a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/q3-2018-restaurant-mergers-and-acquisitions">Read More</a></p>
<p>Like all transformations, a positive outcome following an investment depends on leaders’ understanding of what gives the brand value. It takes more than “good food, good service, good atmosphere” to launch, grow, and maintain a successful restaurant operation, and institutional investors, as well as private equity funds, can often step in to back new concepts or help established chains grow. <a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-investors">Read More</a></p>
<p><a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/public-to-private-restaurants"><img loading="lazy" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/public-to-private-restaurant-deals-1.jpg" alt="public to private restaurant deals" width="1314" height="434" /></a></p>
<p>Since January of 2017, nearly $15b worth of public restaurant stocks in the U.S. delisted, as nine companies left public exchanges for private hands. While the total value and number of global IPOs are increasing, fewer U.S. foodservice companies are going public. The pains of going public these days can be avoided while still gaining funding, as there are trillions in private equity capital ready to be invested in global markets. <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/public-to-private-restaurants">Read More</a></p>
<p><a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/private-equity-investment-overview"><img loading="lazy" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Featured-Overview-Image.png" alt="Restaurant Investment Private Equity Overview" width="1752" height="578" /></a></p>
<p>How could you grow your business with a $50m private equity investment? Would you expand into new markets, roll out the prototypes you’ve been dreaming of, or deploy new technology to make it even easier for diners to get your food? Here we offer a brief overview of PE funds operations, focusing on each stage of the deal. <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/private-equity-investment-overview">Read More</a></p>
<p>Signing a deal with a private equity firm can, naturally, have profound effects on the organization operationally in addition to the impact on value creation strategies and resources. The process has its risks, and teams can often disagree on how to reach goals. Here’s a guide to help restaurant executives prepare for taking on a private equity investment. <a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/preparing-for-private-equity-restaurant-investment">Read More</a></p>
<p><a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/lower-middle-market-return-on-investment"><img loading="lazy" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Lower-Middle-Market-Restaurant-Investment.png" alt="Lower Middle Market Restaurant Investment" width="1752" height="578" /></a></p>
<p>As dry powder continues to grow, a lower middle-market restaurant investment can offer a risk/reward combination on-target with an investment firm&#8217;s criteria. These concepts are becoming an investment sweet spot with valuations attesting to profitability and strong growth. <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/lower-middle-market-return-on-investment">Read More</a></p>
<p>In any scenario, superior intelligence and insights relative to understanding the landscape and how the consumer and competition are being reshaped are required to create a compelling and modernized investment thesis.</p>
<p>When the right components are combined within a platform, the whole can be much greater than the sum of its parts (and this is reflected in valuations). If that’s something you’d be interested in, <a href="https://aaronallen.com/contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we can help</a>. We support both with sell-side mandates and middle-market buy-side advisory for restaurant industry investments.</p>

The number of firms listed on U.S. stock exchanges at the end of the 2017 is less than half the number that appeared twenty years earlier.</p><p>These changes are largely due to transformations in the cost of capital: where once companies often turned to the public to fund their growth, now private money is increasingly available (and attractive) to leaders. As a result, the foodservice sector of public U.S. exchanges — home to the world’s ten largest restaurant companies — is experiencing a net loss due to public-to-private deals. Meanwhile, global IPO value and numbers have started recovering, revealing that there are still very good reasons to go public.</p><h2>While Total Value and Number of Global IPOs Is Increasing, Fewer U.S. Companies Going Public</h2><p>Following the 2008 financial crisis, IPOs across industries and geographies declined but have started to recover.</p>					</div>

				<p>Activity in the restaurant industry follows a similar trajectory: from a peak in 2014 and 2015, IPOs among foodservice companies have largely stalled. There were none in 2016, and only two in 2017. It’s not only the number of deals that’s shrinking; it’s also the amount of capital being raised.</p><p><a href="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/restaurant-IPOs-at-record-lows.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/restaurant-IPOs-at-record-lows.jpg" alt="restaurant IPOs at record lows" width="1216" height="807" /></a></p><p>Aside from notable examples in 2006 (Burger King and Tim Hortons, now consolidated as the public company Restaurant Brands International) and 2011 (Arcos Dorados, Latin America’s McDonald’s franchisor), the value of shares sold in IPOs has remained below $500m in all but one year since 2014.</p><h2>The Pains of Going Public: What Makes Private Capital So Attractive</h2><p>With trillions in private equity capital sloshing around global markets and record-low interest rates, the pains of going public may outweigh the benefits these days. For one, IPOs are costly. They can eat up a significant percentage of the capital raised: about 15% goes to registration and underwriting costs, and companies can leave an additional 15% on the table by underpricing their shares in order to create a first-day rise in value.<sup>2</sup></p><p>Challenges don’t stop after the company debuts: leaders must deal with intense scrutiny from a number of sources:</p><ul><li>Short-Term Investors: The leaders of public companies are often shackled to quarterly reports, their success imperiled by missing targets or a perception crisis that sends stocks plummeting. Many CEOs have expressed frustration with this <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/technology-in-restaurants">short-term focus</a> (most famously Ron Shaich), and a recent survey found that 77% of executives across industries believe their companies would be easier to manage if they were private.</li><li>Short Sellers: Earlier this year, Elon Musk threatened to take Tesla private in part because of the “large numbers of people who have the incentive to attack the company,” referring to the notorious short sellers rooting for the electric car manufacturer to fail.<sup>3</sup></li><li>Activists: In 2017, activist investors bought more than $60b in U.S. stocks across industries, doubling the previous year. This amount of capital gives them immense power over the direction of organizations they invest in, for better and for worse. Bloomin’ Brands, Potbelly, Jack in the Box, and Fiesta Restaurant have all been engaged in disputes with <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-investors">activist investors</a>.</li></ul><p><a href="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/public-to-private-ron-shaich-panera.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/public-to-private-ron-shaich-panera.jpg" alt="public to private ron shaich panera" width="2560" height="1440" /></a></p><p>While it’s no wonder many leaders are turning to private funding, any number of forces could influence them to undertake an IPO. Going public offers a number of benefits:</p><ul><li>Liquidity of Capital: One of the biggest reasons for companies to go public is to gain access to more liquid capital. Private companies, in contrast, often need to launch separate funding rounds, which can take months if not years to complete.</li><li>Publicity: IPOs can increase brand awareness, as news of the stock offering reaches new audiences. This is especially beneficial for restaurant companies looking to finance expansion into new markets.</li><li>Activists: They aren’t going anywhere, and that may benefit leaders of public companies. Stock prices rise around 6% in companies with these activist investors — and those gains last at least five years, according to a 2013 study.<sup>4</sup> We need look no further than Darden for a restaurant-specific example of how engaged activists can turnaround a struggling company.</li></ul>					</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Foodservice is a tough business. It takes more than “good food, good service, good atmosphere” to launch, grow, and maintain a successful restaurant operation. Capital is also necessary — and often a lot of it — especially for chains in their growth stages. Institutional investors, including private equity funds, step in at these moments to back new concepts or help established chains grow.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://aaronallen.com/restaurant-private-equity">private equity space</a>, active involvement by investors is the norm. In contrast, shareholders in publicly traded companies are usually happy to sit back and collect their dividends. Occasionally, however, activist investors, concerned about the company’s direction, act as catalysts for drastic change in governance and strategy, often leveraging short-term agendas that directly impact long-term value.</p>
<p>This investor type buys stock in companies they believe are undervalued, then pushes management to make changes aimed at boosting stock prices. Their demands range from replacing executives to increasing <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/stock-buybacks-dividend-distributions">share buybacks</a>. Though their goal is to increase shareholder value, they don’t always succeed.</p>
<p>In two case studies, we determine that — like all transformations — a positive outcome depends on the leaders’ understanding of what gives the brand value. We also look at three unfolding disputes between restaurant investors and companies, which we’ll be updating as they unfold.</p>
<h2>Restaurant Investors Hold $110b in Publicly Traded Restaurant Stock</h2>
<p>As of March 2018, the top 15 investors in publicly traded foodservice companies held stock worth approximately $110b. The two largest investors — the Vanguard Group ($24.9b) and Blackrock ($23.5b) — are large public asset management companies. These groups, which account for 13 of the 15 on the list, invest in U.S. restaurant stocks to diversify their mutual and exchange-traded funds.<br />
<a href="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/top-restaurant-investors.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-11031" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/top-restaurant-investors.png" alt="" width="843" height="558" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/top-restaurant-investors.png 843w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/top-restaurant-investors-350x232.png 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/top-restaurant-investors-300x199.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/top-restaurant-investors-768x508.png 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/top-restaurant-investors-500x331.png 500w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/top-restaurant-investors-640x424.png 640w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/top-restaurant-investors-187x124.png 187w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/top-restaurant-investors-136x90.png 136w" sizes="(max-width: 843px) 100vw, 843px" /></a></p>
<p>The top 15 includes two groups, 3G Capital ($11.4b) and Pershing Square Capital ($1.3b), that are acting as activist investors. The restaurant space is particularly appealing to activist investors because even the most established brands face challenges that depress profits. For instance, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/chipotle-love-story-competitor-loathing-aaron-d-allen/">Chipotle</a> experienced several quarters of declining top and bottom lines due to its repeated food safety crises, not to mention its continued missteps handling these scandals. Activist investors often look for targets that have strong brand names or large asset portfolios, hoping to more effectively monetize those aspects of the brand.</p>
<div class="infogram-embed" data-id="9a5ded95-5405-4678-a707-059cdb3238b9" data-type="interactive" data-title="US Restaurant Investors"></div>
<p><script>!function(e,t,n,s){var i="InfogramEmbeds",o=e.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?"http:":"https:";if(/^\/{2}/.test(s)&&(s=d+s),window[i]&&window[i].initialized)window[i].process&&window[i].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var a=e.createElement(t);a.async=1,a.id=n,a.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(a,o)}}(document,"script","infogram-async","https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js");</script></p>
<p>Most often, the market reacts positively to the news that an activist investor has bought stock with a struggling brand, since their involvement can signal increased profit. For example, 3G Capital has turned the $3.3b it initially invested in Burger King — which became Restaurant Brands International (RBI) when it bought Tim Hortons in 2014 — into $11.4b in eight years.</p>

<p>Compared to 3G Capital, Pershing Square has a relatively tiny $1.4b invested in RBI, not to mention another $900m in Chipotle.</p>
<h2>Darden’s Success Story Highlights the Power of Activist Investing</h2>
<p>Darden Restaurants experienced an extraordinary turnaround after the activist investor group Starboard Value took control of the company’s board in 2014. Starboard launched a successful revolt that forced then-CEO Clarence Otis out, to be replaced by Gene Lee, the company’s previous COO. Before the shake-up, Darden was underperforming its peers thanks to operational inefficiencies: the company’s sales had fallen from $7.5b in 2013 to $5.9b in 2015 — a 27% decline.</p>
<p>In the infamous Starboard report, the activist investors blasted the Olive Garden parent company for all the ways the current board had hindered the company’s success, from members’ penchant for private jets to failing menu items. After winning all 12 board seats, the group put Darden back on a growth path.</p>
<p>The new leadership revived Olive Garden’s sales by reengineering the menu, expanding alcohol sales, increasing prices, and streamlining kitchen operations, though the most impactful change may have been as simple as improving the breadsticks.</p>
<p>The company witnessed a 155% boost in share price over the past five years. The price doubled from approximately $40 pre-Starboard to $84 in March 2018, growing right along with Olive Garden same-store sales. Since then, prices have continued to rise, standing at $110 as of July 20, 2018.</p>
<p><a href="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Darden-Stock-Price-Restaurant-Investors.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11032" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Darden-Stock-Price-Restaurant-Investors.png" alt="" width="843" height="558" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Darden-Stock-Price-Restaurant-Investors.png 843w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Darden-Stock-Price-Restaurant-Investors-350x232.png 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Darden-Stock-Price-Restaurant-Investors-300x199.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Darden-Stock-Price-Restaurant-Investors-768x508.png 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Darden-Stock-Price-Restaurant-Investors-500x331.png 500w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Darden-Stock-Price-Restaurant-Investors-640x424.png 640w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Darden-Stock-Price-Restaurant-Investors-187x124.png 187w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Darden-Stock-Price-Restaurant-Investors-136x90.png 136w" sizes="(max-width: 843px) 100vw, 843px" /></a></p>
<h2><strong>Jamba Juice: Refranchising Steered by Activists Still Not Paying Off</strong></h2>
<p>Jamba Juice’s stock has been a market slacker in recent years, declining 25% since the company gave two activist investors — Glenn Welling of Engaged Capital and James Pappas of JCP Investment — board seats.</p>
<p>When Welling and Pappas assumed their seats, Jamba was in the midst of a refranchising initiative, which drastically decreased the cost requirements of the organization but also deeply cut into revenue. The company introduced lower-margin menu items, like freshly pressed juices, which has cannibalized smoothie sales and also affected the company’s profit margins.</p>
<p>Since the two investors assumed their board seats, the company’s revenues declined by 56%, from $161.7m in 2015 to $70.9m in 2017, primarily due to the negative impact of refranchising. The operation has sold hundreds of locations, including top performing stores, and then used the proceeds to buy back its own shares. By “refranchising” those valuable stores, the company might have raised less money than the revenue and EBITDA those prime locations would have earned.</p>
<p>The difference between the two case studies comes down to whether or not the activist investors understood their investments’ unique value proposition. Olive Garden’s brand is closely associated with its breadsticks, so improving that menu item improved customer satisfaction. In contrast, Welling and Pappas seem to be focused on raising stock prices — not improving the brands’ long-term success.<strong> </strong></p>
<h2>Restaurant Investors Currently Shaking up Restaurant Operations</h2>
<p>There are three publicly traded companies currently trading barbs with activist investors: Bloomin&#8217; Brands, Potbelly, and Fiesta Restaurants. Though none of the activists have taken control, they are fighting to move the companies in new directions, earning some pushback from the current management team.</p>
<h2>1. Activist Investor Urging Bloomin’ To Focus on Outback Steakhouse and Slice Off the Rest</h2>
<p>Barington Capital (0.44% stake) and Jana Partners (2.58% stake) are both outspoken investors in Bloomin’ Brands. In February 2018, Barington called on the casual-dining chain to spin off some of its brands to improve each concept’s focus. It also suggested revamping the board of directors and implementing more aggressive cost-cutting objectives, highlighting the company’s distance behind the industry’s top players.</p>
<h2>2. Sale, Franchising, or Proxy War Potbelly’s Only Options</h2>
<p>Potbelly is currently facing pressure from activist shareholders Ancora Advisors and Privet Fund Management, who are demanding the company make changes or explore a sale. Ancora’s chairman and chief executive, Fred DiSanto, has criticized the company for opening too many new company-owned locations, arguing that a heavier mix of franchised restaurants could offer a big push to the stock price. Privet Fund, which owns 5.1% of the shares, recently launched a proxy war, seeking to install four nonconformist directors to the board.</p>
<p>If successful, this would put the struggling sandwich chain the hands of the activists, who would most likely sell the company. It is rumored that several private-equity funds expressed their interest.</p>
<p>If unsuccessful, Ancora and Privet have outlined areas for improvement, including rolling out kiosks in lieu of full-scale stores to cut costs on new locations. They also recommend refranchising some of Potbelly’s current locations, as less than 10% are franchise owned.</p>
<h2>3. Fiesta Restaurant: Heated Public Exchange of Insults Between Management and Activist Investor</h2>
<p>In 2017, Fiesta Restaurant came under attack by activist investor MCP Investment. The activist investors accused the company of poor governance, weak operating performance, and failing to exploit the Taco Cabana brand and unlock its growth potential. The 2.93% stake shareholder called for the replacement of two board members before either appointing a new CEO or selling the company.</p>
<p>Fiesta received these demands and statements less-than enthusiastically. The company called MCP Investment’s plan a “cookie-cutter” strategy bound to damage the company and described its “last-minute” plan as what one would expect from a “novice investment banker,” containing a “handful of amateurish and shallow back of the envelope calculations.”</p>
<p>The company’s stock started plunging back in 2015. To address the falling share price and dropping sales, management claims that it took many steps, including evaluating strategic alternatives, appointing Richard Stockinger as the new CEO, improving field operations, and canceling the expansion of Pollo Tropical in Texas due to poor sales.</p>
<p>The company has rejected the activist investor’s suggestion to spin-off the Taco Cabana and Pollo Tropical brands, instead investing in marketing to increase the brand awareness and reexamining its development strategy.</p>
<p>We’ll be following these stories as they unfold, as they offer important lessons not only for restaurant investors but also for operators, who can learn from these very public successes and mistakes.</p>

<p>Data for the top 100 foodservice groups in the US shows that those with up to three brands have a median sales CAGR 55% greater than what groups with four or more brands achieve. Similar differences appear in every quartile of the distribution.</p>
<p>These large restaurant portfolios face challenges that single- or double-brand companies don’t seem to have. For one, companies with three or more brands tend to have lower bottom lines.</p>

<p><a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-cash-flow-statement">Net income to revenue</a> for restaurant portfolios in this segment reached a median 3.3% in 2017. Publicly traded companies with fewer brands had median bottom lines more than 50% higher at a median of 5.1%. SG&amp;A and other expenses seem to be adding up significantly as the number of brands in the portfolio increases.</p>
<p>Further, the greater number of brands seems to be stretching out management and shared resources, lowering the potential value of individual concepts within the group.</p>

<p>Publicly traded companies in the US with three or more brands have a median enterprise value per brand of $242m, 86% lower than that attained by companies with two brands, and 64% lower than those with a single brand in their portfolio.</p>
<p>We found the same underdevelopment when we looked at average revenue per brand.<a href="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurant-Portfolios-Brand-Revenue.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-10928" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurant-Portfolios-Brand-Revenue-1024x679.png" alt="Restaurant Portfolios Brand Revenue" width="980" height="650" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurant-Portfolios-Brand-Revenue-1024x679.png 1024w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurant-Portfolios-Brand-Revenue-350x232.png 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurant-Portfolios-Brand-Revenue-300x199.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurant-Portfolios-Brand-Revenue-768x509.png 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurant-Portfolios-Brand-Revenue-970x643.png 970w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurant-Portfolios-Brand-Revenue-500x332.png 500w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurant-Portfolios-Brand-Revenue-640x424.png 640w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurant-Portfolios-Brand-Revenue-187x124.png 187w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurant-Portfolios-Brand-Revenue-136x90.png 136w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurant-Portfolios-Brand-Revenue.png 1695w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px" /></a></p>
<p>Among the top 100 foodservice groups in the US, the average revenue for brands from single-brand companies was $935m in 2016, while individual brands in companies managing five or more concepts would only bring 27% as much per brand.</p>
<p>There are, of course, outliers. <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/franchise-restaurant-earnings-per-share">Starbucks</a>, along with other larger restaurant portfolios like Energy Transfer Equity, Food Management Partners, JAB Holdings, and Sun Holdings, had greater than +8.1% CAGR between 2014 and 2016. And, some large-cap operations have multiple brands and a large average EV per brand: Starbucks (again), Restaurant Brands International (RBI), and Yum! Brands. Those same three organizations also have higher profitability.</p>
<p>Though every case is different, it seems likely that underperforming brands are taking time and resources away from their higher-performing counterparts, as CEOs, CFOs, and CMOs must devote energy to each concept in the group’s portfolio.</p>
<p>With a lower number of brands, not only can the executive team focus on properly developing the concept, but they also aren’t required to track sales, growth, revenue, loss, turnover, and other KPIs across different brands, cuisines, and segments.</p>
<p>As a result, multi-brand portfolios appear to struggle to deliver year-over-year growth, and many of their brands cannot develop to their fullest potential. Our data supports the notion that more focused portfolios are better able to deliver strong returns on both a brand level and as a group.</p>
<p>That said, we wouldn’t encourage multi-brand organizations to immediately divest based on this analysis. Rather, this information highlights the importance of gaining an integrated view of how brands in a portfolio fit together.</p>
<p>Is the portfolio diversified? Does each brand cover a specific segment or geography? Is there strong differentiation between the concepts? Are there emerging trends or markets that will change this balance?</p>
<p>With these questions at the center of a portfolio optimization process, foodservice groups can ensure that they are building sustainable growth — rather than just collecting stamps.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even a decade after the Great Recession, <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-commercial-lending">restaurant commercial lending</a> remains tight, but there’s still a tremendous amount of <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/q1-2018-restaurant-merger-acquisition">eager capital</a> around the globe. Foodservice companies are increasingly turning to different sources to fund their restaurant expansions.</p>
<p>Restaurants have proved particularly intriguing to <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/private-equity-investment-overview">private equity (PE) firms</a>, and we’ve been approached by $3b–$4b in capital from institutional investors, earmarked for deployment in the global F&amp;B space (particularly in the GCC, European, Indian, and US markets). In short, there’s a lot of interest — the challenge now is for would-be sellers to connect with the right buyers.</p>
<p>Both prestigious private equity firms and institutional investors are looking for concepts growing in the US as well as those planning for cross-border expansion. On average, we&#8217;ve seen firms with anywhere from $300m–$800m allocated for restaurant-specific investment funds. While every transaction would be unique, most PE investors are interested in concepts with more than $5m in system-wide EBITDA.</p>
<p>Investors are showing more and more interest in <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/lower-middle-market-return-on-investment">middle-market operations</a>, defined as businesses with between $500m and $1b in enterprise value. In the US, middle-market companies make up 74.1% of all PE-backed company inventory. We&#8217;ve also noticed that this inventory is increasingly concentrated in relatively young companies.</p>
<p>The trend toward middle-market deals indicates an overarching move away from investment in only the biggest chains — an incredible opportunity for small concepts.</p>
<p>Here’s how to take advantage.</p>
<h2>Private Equity’s Financial &amp; Managerial Firepower Helps Restaurant Expansions Scale Up</h2>
<p>A private equity investment doesn’t just pay for expansion — the analytic firepower and managerial expertise that come with the right kind of partnership help chains adapt their organizational infrastructure to meet the complex challenges larger operations face.</p>
<p>Getting expansion right is notoriously difficult: every aspect of the business, from supply chains and industrial engineering to marketing strategies and training modules must scale up with the number of locations.</p>
<p>What sets private equity firms apart is that the buy-side team takes an active role in managing their investments post-transaction, granting restaurateurs access to some of the brightest analytic minds, who will provide clearsighted forecasts of both the operation’s and the industry’s future.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10896" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurant-Expansion-Investors.jpg" alt="Restaurant Expansion Investors" width="2559" height="853" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurant-Expansion-Investors.jpg 2559w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurant-Expansion-Investors-350x117.jpg 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurant-Expansion-Investors-300x100.jpg 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurant-Expansion-Investors-768x256.jpg 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurant-Expansion-Investors-1024x341.jpg 1024w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurant-Expansion-Investors-970x323.jpg 970w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurant-Expansion-Investors-660x220.jpg 660w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurant-Expansion-Investors-280x92.jpg 280w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurant-Expansion-Investors-500x167.jpg 500w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurant-Expansion-Investors-640x213.jpg 640w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurant-Expansion-Investors-220x73.jpg 220w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurant-Expansion-Investors-160x53.jpg 160w" sizes="(max-width: 2559px) 100vw, 2559px" /></p>
<p>This expertise is particularly useful when embarking on a national or <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/international-restaurant-expansion">international expansion</a>. The financial modeling and projections (supported by the partnership with <a href="https://aaronallen.com/restaurant-commercial-due-diligence">CDD experts</a>) will give all partners a deep understanding of the economic forces shaping the industry so that they can make informed decisions about which markets to penetrate.</p>
<p>Private equity firms also bring managerial expertise to the table. When a small restaurant chain begins to expand quickly, how it runs on a day-to-day basis changes character radically, across all functional areas.</p>
<p>Our most common finding when working the middle-market operators is that they are stretched too thin. The systems put in place for marketing, inventory, and training were perfectly sized for ten units, but, now that they’ve reached 25, the underlying infrastructure is no longer equipped to support the operation. Often, the people running those (now expanded) departments don’t have experience within large organizations.</p>
<p>Though few private equity firms specialize in the restaurant industry, they all focus on increasing their investments’ valuation. The most common way to accomplish this goal is to find more efficient ways of doing business. This knowledge is an incredible value-add for a restaurant operation experiencing the growing pains of expansion.</p>
<h2>A Sell-Side Advisor Will Protect Your Interests</h2>
<p>As of June 2017, private equity assets under management reached an all-time high, at an estimated $2.8t. With plenty of capital still looking for a home, hot restaurant concepts will likely have their pick of potential partners.</p>

<p>These investments often produce incredible results. In an ideal world, the two parties come together to create a whole that’s much greater than the sum of its parts. Knowing which offer to take isn’t just a matter of money — restaurant operators should bring in external help to offer unbiased opinions of all comers.</p>
<p>With the right guidance, raising capital can propel an operation forward — so emerging concepts should be sure to have a <a href="https://aaronallen.com/restaurant-private-equity">sell-side advisor</a> that can support their biggest dreams.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Restaurant enterprise value (EV) is easy to calculate: market cap + debt – cash.  It’s much harder to understand what causes EV to rise and fall.</p>
<p>To help unravel this mystery, we examined EV enhancements among publicly traded restaurants over the past 20 years, looking for trends that produced long- and short-term gains.</p>
<p>We found that most of the big, sustainable enhancements were made by quick-service (QSR) brands, which is the largest segment of publicly traded restaurants in the US, accounting for 65% of all restaurants’ EV.</p>
<p><a href="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurants-EV-by-Segment-Share-of-QSR-Increasing.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-10886 size-large" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurants-EV-by-Segment-Share-of-QSR-Increasing-1024x681.png" alt="Restaurants EV by Segment Share of QSR Increasing" width="980" height="652" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurants-EV-by-Segment-Share-of-QSR-Increasing-1024x681.png 1024w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurants-EV-by-Segment-Share-of-QSR-Increasing-350x233.png 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurants-EV-by-Segment-Share-of-QSR-Increasing-300x200.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurants-EV-by-Segment-Share-of-QSR-Increasing-768x511.png 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurants-EV-by-Segment-Share-of-QSR-Increasing-970x645.png 970w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurants-EV-by-Segment-Share-of-QSR-Increasing-500x333.png 500w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurants-EV-by-Segment-Share-of-QSR-Increasing-640x426.png 640w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurants-EV-by-Segment-Share-of-QSR-Increasing-186x124.png 186w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurants-EV-by-Segment-Share-of-QSR-Increasing-135x90.png 135w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Restaurants-EV-by-Segment-Share-of-QSR-Increasing.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px" /></a></p>
<p>The QSR segment  has enjoyed the fastest median growth over the last three years, adding 8.6 percentage points, mostly at the expense of fast casual (-5.7 pp) and casual dining (-2.5 pp).</p>
<p>Though there’s no secret formula for growing EV, the most successful companies added value by maintaining their brand identities, carefully expanding their footprints, strategically investing in technology, and making smart acquisitions.</p>
<h2>Expansion Drives EV &amp; Stock Price Gains</h2>
<p>Only 16 of the 48 publicly traded restaurant companies analyzed have data that go back 20 years. Of those, BJ’s restaurant has by far the highest EV CAGR: 24.4% to second-place Starbucks’ 17.6%.</p>
<p><a href="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Publicly-Traded-Restaurants-Enterprise-Value-Growth.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-10881" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Publicly-Traded-Restaurants-Enterprise-Value-Growth-1024x679.png" alt="Publicly Traded Restaurants Enterprise Value Growth" width="980" height="650" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Publicly-Traded-Restaurants-Enterprise-Value-Growth-1024x679.png 1024w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Publicly-Traded-Restaurants-Enterprise-Value-Growth-350x232.png 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Publicly-Traded-Restaurants-Enterprise-Value-Growth-300x199.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Publicly-Traded-Restaurants-Enterprise-Value-Growth-768x509.png 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Publicly-Traded-Restaurants-Enterprise-Value-Growth-970x643.png 970w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Publicly-Traded-Restaurants-Enterprise-Value-Growth-500x331.png 500w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Publicly-Traded-Restaurants-Enterprise-Value-Growth-640x424.png 640w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Publicly-Traded-Restaurants-Enterprise-Value-Growth-187x124.png 187w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Publicly-Traded-Restaurants-Enterprise-Value-Growth-136x90.png 136w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Publicly-Traded-Restaurants-Enterprise-Value-Growth.png 1605w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px" /></a></p>
<p>The coffee giant’s second-place finish can be attributed to the timing of this twenty-year snapshot. BJ’s went public in 1996, and that same year, it massively expanded its footprint by buying and retrofitting 26 Pietro’s Pizza locations. Since then, it has grown even more: now 11 breweries supply over 130 locations with the chain’s award-winning beer.</p>
<p>In contrast, Starbucks was already well on its way to global domination in 1996. When it first went public in 1992, it already had 140 outlets, and, in 1996, it had already reached 1,000. (It currently has over 23,000 units around the world.)</p>
<p>Because enterprise value is by definition highly correlated with stock price gains, it should come as no surprise that the companies with the highest EV gains also had top-quartile stock performance. Under this metric, Starbucks and BJ’s trade places.</p>
<div class="infogram-embed" data-id="423d592c-b4d6-4004-9a5f-c99058e393db" data-type="interactive" data-title="Restaurant Enterprise Value"></div>

<p>Starbucks’ stock price grew from a humble $1.86 per share in 1997 to a remarkable $56.21 in 2017, amassing total gains of 2,914%. As a result, the coffee chain’s EV grew by $79.2b — the equivalent of Yum! Brands’, Restaurant Brands International’s, and Darden’s 2017 EVs combined.</p>
<h2>High Stock Prices Don’t Always Translate into EV Gains</h2>
<p>Good Times Restaurants’ EV value grew the most over the period 2012–2017, with a five-year CAGR of 40.3% or a total gain of 443.9%.</p>

<p>The company’s enterprise value was only $6.8 million in 2012, but it skyrocketed to $36.8m in 2015 after it acquired Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar for $21m. Despite this massive EV rise, the company’s stock price has fallen by 15.2% over the same period because it has been unable to successfully integrate the newly acquired business into its operations.</p>
<p>Texas Roadhouse and <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/dominos-turnaround">Domino’s Pizza</a> also appeared among the top gainers as they saw their enterprise values rise by 226.0% and 187.0%, respectively. Both could be explained by increased in stock price: Domino’s has increased 393.5% (from $43.84 in 2012 to $216.32 in 2017) and Texas Roadhouse’s has appreciated 268.8% (from $15.86 in 2012 to $58.47 in 2017).</p>
<p>On the opposite side of the spectrum, Bravo Brio’s share value was slashed by 70.6% (from $14.90 in 2012 to $3.43 in 2017) as sales slumped due to recurring hurricanes in Texas and Florida and as the company closed down poorly performing restaurants in response to a downturn. The Italian restaurant chain was <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/q1-2018-restaurant-merger-acquisition">recently taken private</a> by Spice Private Equity.</p>
<h2>Smart Franchising Strategies Can Increase EV for Franchisee &amp; Franchisor</h2>
<p>In 2017, Arcos Dorados — the largest McDonald’s franchisee with around 2,000 locations in Latin America — achieved the highest enterprise gain, with a total growth rate of 58.5% (from $1.6m in 2016 to $2.6m in 2017), driven by a sharp increase of 76.7% in its stock price.</p>

<p>The franchisee also posted outstanding earnings results thanks to the parent company’s <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/franchise-restaurant-earnings-per-share">refranchising plan</a>, adding 50 restaurants in 2017, in addition to its efforts to streamline cost structures and reduce debt levels.</p>
<h2>Consistent Restaurant EV Enhancements Come from Brand Identity, Technology, and Expansion</h2>
<p>The following  companies had the highest EV enhancements over the past 20 years and offer eight important lessons for growing value.</p>
<div class="infogram-embed" data-id="d3dad3fd-d968-4843-a2a6-741eb8eff2bf" data-type="interactive" data-title="Restaurant Enterprise Value Top Gainers"></div>
<p><script>!function(e,t,n,s){var i="InfogramEmbeds",o=e.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?"http:":"https:";if(/^\/{2}/.test(s)&&(s=d+s),window[i]&&window[i].initialized)window[i].process&&window[i].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var a=e.createElement(t);a.async=1,a.id=n,a.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(a,o)}}(document,"script","infogram-async","https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js");</script></p>
<p>Two-thirds of these companies were QSR chains, showing that this segment has incredible staying power. Each operation has important lessons.</p>
<h2>1. STARBUCKS: Successful acquisition activity and strong customer connections</h2>
<p>Starbucks’ enterprise value has expanded from $3.2b in 1997 to $82.3b in 2017 (+2,463%). In this period, the coffee giant has sought to diversify its offerings by acquiring Tazo, Ethos Water, Teavana, and others. Starbucks has always fought for brand loyalty by emphasizing its third-place strategy, and it continually draws customers into its store by offering hugely popular limited time offers.</p>
<h2>2. WENDY’S CO: Successful franchise incentives</h2>
<p>Wendy’s enterprise value grew from $838.9m in 1997 to $6.5b (+676.8%) in 2017. The fast-food chain launched its Image Activation Program in 2013 to incentivize franchise locations to remodel, recognizing that dine-customers spend more per order than carry-out or drive-thru guests.</p>
<h2>3. DARDEN RESTAURANTS: Distinct brand identities</h2>
<p>Darden Restaurants’ enterprise value grew from $2.0b in 1997 to $12.8b in 2017 (+537.5%). This growth has been powered by the company’s large scale of operations and distinct identity for each restaurant brand in its portfolio. Each concept stands on its own merits, allowing the company to cater to diverse customer segments.</p>
<h2>4. DOMINO’S PIZZA: Heavy tech investments</h2>
<p><a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/dominos-turnaround">Domino&#8217;s enterprise value</a> grew from $1.9b in 2004 to $11.4b in 2017 (+478.9%). The pizza chain has long been on the bleeding edge of delivery technology, anticipating the consumer demand for convenience much earlier than its competitors.</p>
<h2>5. YUM! BRANDS: International expansion &amp; a solid franchise business</h2>
<p>Yum! Brands’ enterprise value grew from $8.2b in 1998 to $36.4b in 2017 (+316.0%).  Efficient store modeling allowed the company — which owns KFC, Pizza Hut, Wingstop, and Taco Bell — to generated strong unit-level returns. Further, the high ratio of franchise-owned restaurants has helped Yum! reduce operating costs and expenses.</p>
<h2>6. TEXAS ROADHOUSE: A consistent business model</h2>
<p>Texas Roadhouse has grown its EV from $960.0m in 2004 to $3.7b in 2017 (+285.3%). The company has been able to deliver strong traffic growth in a difficult casual dining environment thanks to the unique dining experience. The addition of Bubba’s 33, a newer sports bar concept, has offered higher profitability and margins.</p>
<h2>7. McDONALD’S: Brand positioning</h2>
<p>McDonald’s EV grew from $38.9b in 1997 to $163.2b in 2017 (+319.8%). Over the past 20 years, McDonald&#8217;s strong credit rating has given it the flexibility to invest in key growth initiatives, while returning significant amounts of cash to shareholders. At the same time, Steve Easterbrook’s brilliant repositioning of McDonald’s as a value brand has brought customers back into stores over recent years.</p>
<h2>8. RUTH’S GROUP: Healthy sales growth and improving balance sheet</h2>
<p>Ruth’s EV grew from $442m in 2005 to $702m in 2017 (+58.9%). The company has seen healthy growth across the operation. The company behind Ruth&#8217;s Chris Steak House and Mitchell&#8217;s Fish Market has a mix of company-owned and franchised stores and has worked to improve its balance sheet and boost shareholders’ returns via a growing dividend.</p>

				<p>There is plenty of capital sloshing around out there, and no matter if you are a restaurant chain, a foodservice contractor, a supplier, or a restaurant technology company, getting your fair share will require a significant commitment of resources (time, focus, preparation, investment).</p><p>It’s a common misconception among those that have bootstrapped or raised capital primarily from known providers (friends and family) to think all that’s needed is a business that’s humming and a figure in mind and then investors just wire millions of dollars within a few weeks of meeting. That’s not at all how it works in the real world though.</p><div class="">As you think about how to temper your own expectations &#8230; one wouldn&#8217;t expect to catch a prized fish without a rod and reel — much less win the lottery without even buying a ticket. </div><div class=""> </div><div class="">Put another way, if you were on the receiving end, would you…</div><div class=""><ul class=""><li class="">Invest in a company who&#8217;s business plan is written on a cocktail napkin (with bad handwriting)?</li><li class="">Hire a key member of management who doesn’t have a professional resume or bio? </li><li class="">Make one of the biggest purchases of your life based on loose paperwork and verbal promises? </li></ul></div><div class="">The world of investing is very different for those that invest and those that seek investment. But, if either were to take a moment to put themselves in the shoes of the other, they could probably arrive at a better, shared understanding of what the parties need to do individually and collectively if they are to consummate a meaningful commercial deal. </div><h2>It Takes Money to Raise Money </h2><p>Qualified middle-market investors will require a lot more than a one-page business plan downloaded from the internet and filled-in in a couple of hours. And it will cost far more in lost opportunity to skimp on hiring professionals to help you prepare.</p><p>Quality advisors will more than pay for themselves with: </p><ul><li><strong>Shorter Time to Close</strong>: Raising capital or looking for investors to exit the business is time-consuming. Since the <a href="https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/deals/mergers-acquisitions-ma-process/">M&amp;A process</a> can take anywhere from 6–12 months, attempting to do so while running the business day-to-day is most likely to negatively impact performance. These efforts can also be a distraction for a prolonged period with do-it-yourself approaches. In the end, an advisor will save you time, likely earn you a higher valuation, and spare you headaches.</li><li><strong>Higher Valuation</strong>: The better you look on paper, the higher value you’ll reap. If your brand has a strong pipeline of franchisees, it will earn a better multiple. Quick-service restaurant (QSR) chains — on the whole — receive higher valuations than casual dining. The same goes for purpose-drive brands. A specialized <a href="https://aaronallen.com/restaurant-mergers-and-acquisitions">industry M&amp;A</a> advisor will be able to assess what’s a fair offer and sell the rationale to investors, paying for themselves many times over throughout the process.</li><li><strong>Higher Certainty to Close</strong>: M&amp;A advisors know what investors want (and sometimes more importantly, what they don’t want), and how to best position the sell-side to avoid mistakes that would get the opportunity spiked at the teaser round, and watch out for potential missteps that would leave the buy-side with the wrong impression. This will reduce the chance of having a dead or broken deal process.</li><li><strong>Improved Positioning, Improved Results</strong>: Like writing your own resume or trying to act as your own agent when negotiating, the more professional somebody can make you look — the more likely you are to succeed (and your reward will be all the higher). Having professionally crafted collaterals enables the process to run smoothly on your side by already anticipating investors&#8217; requests. On the contrary, if materials are underwhelming and the process is sloppy and full of first-time seller mistakes, the buyer may back off, thinking (rightly or wrongly) the company may not have the right infrastructure and systems in place.</li><li><strong>Enhanced Buy-Side Competition</strong>: When an M&amp;A advisor runs a process (after developing all the collaterals), they will reach out to highly qualified buyers and maintain a competitive process to boost valuation and improve certainty to close. Competition amongst capital providers is a significant advantage to the seller. The advisor also knows who to reach, so it’s not a waste of time. Depending on the size of the company, some would be fit for <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-venture-capital">venture capital</a>, others for private equity, and some would better match the mandate of some family offices.</li><li><strong>Minimized Headaches</strong>: An M&amp;A advisor can provide objectivity and act as a representative in negotiations, so you don’t have to drag through long conversations in which many details can alter the benefits of the deal. How the deal is closed, how the payment is made, what happens to the teams afterward, how involved (if at all) the owner will be in the future, and many other complexities are hard to manage and risky to attempt if you don’t have any M&amp;A experience. As a seller, you also don’t want to stand alone in front of professional <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-due-diligence">due diligence</a> teams that are tasked with trying to poke holes into the deal if the information presented is not accurate and presented with a perspective that brings the right light into the business.</li></ul>					</div>

				<h2>What Does an M&amp;A Advisor Do?</h2><p>An <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/m-advisory-firm-163955251.html">M&amp;A advisor</a> will work as an intermediary facilitating an investment or acquisition process. The advisor can provide expertise across the stages of the M&amp;A process for the buy-side or sell-side. When a company is considering the sale of a minority or majority stake, they can hire a sell-side advisor.</p><p>Supporting the sell-side process ranges from assessing the business and developing collaterals to negotiations and the selling of the business. In this type of engagement, the sell-side typically pays an engagement and success fee to best align incentives on outcomes.</p><p>When <a href="https://www.grantthornton.global/en/insights/articles/Getting-ready-for-private-equity-investment/">preparing for a private equity</a> investment, sell-side advisors can support with:</p><ul><li><strong>Pre-Deal:</strong> Through conducting a readiness audit, the sell-side advisor may pressure test the business for flaws and weaknesses that would arise during diligence. This way the seller can overcome problems ahead of time and make improvements to be better positioned ahead of moving into a transaction process.</li><li><strong>Building Collaterals:</strong> Professional marketing materials range from only preparing a CIM (Confidential Investment Memorandum) to potentially building comprehensive business plans, value enhancement strategies, and financial models that investors will want to see to assess the value of the business more fully.</li><li><strong>Deal Management Concierge Services:</strong> The M&amp;A advisor has a network of industry investors to reach out for buyer identification. They will approach third parties and assess their qualifications and intentions to acquire or invest in the business. From there they will run a competitive process, circulating materials and collecting bids (which may involve several rounds of negotiations).</li><li><strong>Supporting Diligence Requests and Closing Negotiations: </strong>Once one or two potential buyers have submitted letters of intent (LOIs), the advisor will support due diligence requests from the buy-side (so that it interferes as little as possible with the normal business operations), ensure strategic alignment with the plan (in the case of minority investors), and close the transaction.</li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-21032 size-full" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/sell-side-MA-process.jpg" alt="sell-side M&amp;A process" width="2122" height="698" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/sell-side-MA-process.jpg 2122w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/sell-side-MA-process-300x99.jpg 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/sell-side-MA-process-1024x337.jpg 1024w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/sell-side-MA-process-768x253.jpg 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/sell-side-MA-process-1536x505.jpg 1536w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/sell-side-MA-process-2048x674.jpg 2048w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/sell-side-MA-process-1568x516.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 2122px) 100vw, 2122px" /></p><p>Effectively selling a business doesn’t happen overnight.

				<h2>How Much Do M&amp;A Advisors Charge?</h2><p>There’s usually a <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/952326/worldwide-advisory-fees-for-successful-mergers-and-acquisitions/">range of fees</a> and they can also differ in their structure. For example:</p><p><strong>Investment Banks:</strong> Usually more than a couple hundred thousand dollars to get started, and success fees are in the millions to tens of millions. There’s often a minimum potential success fee (industry standard of $1m) to take on a project.</p><p><strong>M&amp;A Advisory:</strong> Usually have a more adequate price for lower and middle market. An initial fee of $100-$200k+ is usually applicable to take the company to an “investable” point, building out marketing materials and, oftentimes, financial models. On-going retainers throughout the transaction process are standard, with success fees typically ranging between 5–10% of enterprise value (depending on the size of the transaction).</p><p><strong>Business Brokers:</strong> Typically assist with selling or buying small companies (for example an independent restaurant or a small franchisee with a couple of locations). They help secure a price, fill in paperwork, and they’re paid through a commission (usually more than 5%) of the enterprise value. They don’t typically help build business models or marketing materials.</p><h3>Sell-Side Fees Explained</h3><p>Since there are several factors impacting fee structures, it&#8217;s helpful to assess possibilities prior to making a decision on future steps. For instance, an advisor that only charges a success fee may seem like a good deal on the surface, but most likely they will not look past the first offer (and you may leave significant money on the table in the end). In some cases, a monthly fee may sound too high, but the advisor is willing to detract it from the success fee when the transaction closes, the additional investment would ultimately be in the best interest of the business. </p><p>An overview on some of the typical sell-side advisor compensation buckets is available below.</p>					</div>

				<h2>Tips To Help You Pick the Right M&amp;A Advisor</h2><p>Finding the right partner to help you sell your business can be a nuanced process. Just like any relationship — personal or professional — trust is usually key for a successful partnership. Here are some things to look for in an M&amp;A advisor: </p><ul><li><strong>Network</strong>: It’s important to understand the depth of connections (know-who) the advisor has (are these real connections or are they reaching out to random e-mails they found on the internet?). The advisor shouldn’t just contact as many potential investors as possible without vetting them (many of them won’t be qualified to buy your business and your data could fall at the hands of the competition).</li><li><strong>Industry Expertise</strong>: Will the advisor be able to make a fair and accurate recommendation on valuation? Will they be able to understand and market the growth plans? Industry acumen is a significant part of what the advisor can bring to the process.</li></ul>					</div>

									<span><p>There are nuances between a minority investment (&lt;50% ownership), majority investment (50%+ investment), and full buyout (100% acquisition). The process in preparing materials is relatively similar for each, as investors at any stake will be looking for a clear understanding of the business in which they are investing.</p><p>Majority investments and full acquisitions are most likely to include potential changes to management teams and controls of the business, whereas a minority investment allows the business owner to retain control over the company.</p></span>									</span>

									<span>
									<span><p>While these terms are used often interchangeably, they are quite different. Venture capital providers are financing startup or small business that are expected to generate high (above average) returns. VC investments are often minority positions and are typically seen as inherently riskier than private equity, though they often see a higher return on investment as a reward. Private equity investors purchase an interest in later-stage (more established) companies that are not publicly traded. These investment levels are traditionally higher and can range from minority to majority stakes or full buyouts.</p></span>									</span>

Investors, naturally, want to know what they are investing in — and a comprehensive business plan (not simply an Excel spreadsheet with straight-line projections) is often one of the best ways to communicate the opportunity and potential for a prospective investment.</p></span>									</span>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How could you grow your business with a $50m private equity investment? Would you expand into new markets, roll out the prototypes you&#8217;ve been dreaming of, or deploy new technology to make it even easier for diners to get your food? We&#8217;re predicting a lot of activity in the <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/lower-middle-market-return-on-investment">lower middle-market segment</a>, where strong valuations and solid growth are attracting a lot of interest. Already this year, firms representing $3–$4b in buy-side capital have approached us, looking for the next big thing in foodservice.</p>
<p>The world of private equity investments is complex. Here we offer a brief overview of PE funds operations, focusing specifically on each stage of the deal, while a second post has a six-step guide for getting a restaurant operation transaction ready.</p>

<p>A typical private equity firm has a group of general partners, or fund managers, who raise capital, find investment opportunities, and oversee the organization’s portfolio. These funds don’t select businesses that seem like they will grow on their own; instead, they take an active hand in building value over the life of the investment. Most general partners have deep expertise in managerial strategies and want to help their investments streamline operations, optimize efficiency and performance, and grow in a sustainable way.</p>
<p>This means private equity firms are by and large strategic, as opposed to financial, investors. Financial buyers have a more hands-off approach: they want to put money in, let the existing operation grow it, and take it out a few years later. In contrast, strategic buyers recognize their target investments as collaborators in value growth.</p>
<p>Some firms specialize in specific industries, while others are striving to offer a well-rounded portfolio to the institutional and individual investors who put capital into the fund. In either case, private equity firms expect to take an active role in managing the businesses in their portfolios.</p>
<p>The investment funds come from the firm itself and from limited partners — often pension funds, insurance companies, or other nations’ sovereign wealth funds, though HNWIs sometimes contribute as well.</p>
<p>Firms invest in and acquire companies that seem likely to increase in value over the course of the investment. This may mean the business is underperforming or undervalued, or it may mean that the general partners recognize that the restaurant has something special: a new concept just waiting to go national (or international), hold on a hard-to-claim market share, or an operational system that could revolutionize the industry.</p>
<p>Regardless of a firm’s area of specialty or reason for investing, most follow a similar life cycle:</p>
<h2>Fundraising Period</h2>
<p>General partners solicit funds for a particular project from limited partners. The firm may define these projects narrowly (“acquire in Bob’s Fine Dining on Spruce Street”) or broadly (“invest in a restaurant chain in North Africa”)</p>
<h2>Hold Period</h2>
<p>After signing investment and acquisition deals, fund managers work with the restaurant’s executive team to grow revenue and improve margins. Cash flows tend to break even in years three to five.</p>
<p>The length of the hold period will vary. Some firms, like Berkshire Hathaway, prefer longer hold periods, which allow management and efficiency improvements to mature. Others go for quick flips, with investments sometimes lasting as little as 12 weeks (in the case of Blackstone’s 2016 sale of Strategic Hotels &amp; Resorts).</p>
<p>Today, the average hold period is just over five years, up from the much shorter 3.3 year (median) between 2006 and 2008.</p>
<h2>Harvest Period</h2>
<p>Funds sell their stake in the company or make an initial public offering (IPO). General partners claim 20% of the profit and distribute the rest to their limited partners.</p>
<p>Fund managers walk a tightrope. On the one hand, they have capital that must be put to work. On the other hand, they have a group of investors expecting a certain rate of return, so they must avoid risky deals that won’t deliver.</p>
<p>To find the sweet spot between profit and risk, funds undertake intensive pre-deal research into their targets’ financial, legal, commercial, and operational status and prospects. Each step of the deal timeline involves increasing scrutiny and discussion, all building to a final bid that satisfies both parties and sets them up for post-deal success.</p>

<p>After a PE firm raises money, it must decide where to put it. Fund managers go through seven stages of research, due diligence, and negotiation to find a partnership or sale that fits in with their strategic goals.</p>
<h2>Sourcing</h2>
<p>Firms locate target investments and acquisitions in a number of ways. Using their own research or intermediaries, they’ll learn about opportunities that other firms may not be aware of. (Many fund managers approach our consultancy for just this insider knowledge, so that we play matchmakers in their next deal.)</p>
<p>Restaurants may also circulate teasers to alert private equity firms to new opportunities in a process known as a public auction. Before contacting the target, the firm will conduct preliminary studies to assess the opportunity. If it seems like a good investment, the fund manager and restaurant will sign an NDA, and the restaurant will share its <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-confidential-information-memorandum">Confidential Information Memorandum</a>.</p>
<h2>Letter of Intent (LOI)</h2>
<p>The firm may present sellers with an LOI, which outlines the deal in broad terms and may contain an exclusivity clause. The sell-side team should share this document — especially language around an exclusivity period, purchase price, and deal conditions — with legal counsel, as it may contain unfavorable terms.</p>
<h2><a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-due-diligence">Due Diligence</a></h2>
<p>The PE firm will conduct research on the industry, hold discussions with expert consultants, and build preliminary financial projections. The restaurant will provide confidential to help fund managers embark on a thorough round of financial, legal, commercial, and operational due diligence. (See our <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/due-diligence-checklist">due diligence checklist</a> to understand which documents investors are likely to request.)</p>
<h2>First-Round Bid</h2>
<p>If due diligence doesn’t surface any red flags and the investment appears to be a good strategic fit, the firm will submit a first-round bid. In public auctions, where more than one firm is involved, the sell-side team will select which firms move on to the next round.</p>
<h2>Modeling &amp; Strategic Alignment</h2>
<p>Following a more detailed investment model, the firm will lay out its comprehensive investment thesis, explaining why it&#8217;s looking to invest in this particular operation, and its strategic plan. A Preliminary Investment Memorandum will summarize the opportunity for the benefit of the firm&#8217;s Investment Committee.</p>
<h2>Binding Bid</h2>
<p>A Final Investment Memorandum (FIM) will be drafted, informed by further <a href="https://aaronallen.com/restaurant-private-equity">buy-side due diligence</a> (often conducted by third-party consultants). The FIM includes purchase price and preliminary merger agreements, which describe changes to the target&#8217;s management team, employment structure, stock options, and so on.</p>
<h2>Closing</h2>
<p>Though it&#8217;s called a binding bid, there&#8217;s still room for negotiations. The potential investor and target company will meet to discuss every detail of the offer. The PE firm will come with lawyers experienced in investment transactions — and so should restaurant operators.</p>
<p>To prepare for this process, restaurants should start about 18 months before the desired closing date. In that time, they should undertake the same in-depth study of their organization as investors will throughout the pre-deal process. With this information, the operation can accurately estimate its value, identify red and yellow flags that could negatively affect the transaction, and speak more confidently about the deal to potential investors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the world of restaurant mergers and acquisitions, <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/largest-restaurant-acquisitions">big deals </a>— like 2017’s sales of Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen ($1.8b) or Panera Bread (~$7.5b) — tend to get the most attention. But private equity firms should also look at lower middle-market restaurant investment opportunities for deals that deliver solid growth to their partners.</p>
<p>Across the investment landscape, most middle-market activity has been concentrated in the upper-middle market (enterprises valued between $500m and $1b). Deals in the core middle market ($100m to $500m) and lower middle market ($25m to $100m) have decreased over the last five years.</p>
<div class="infogram-embed" data-id="a8ae5c53-da26-4fbe-9eba-dae5514481c9" data-type="interactive" data-title="Lower Middle Market Private Equity"></div>
<p><script>!function(e,t,n,s){var i="InfogramEmbeds",o=e.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?"http:":"https:";if(/^\/{2}/.test(s)&&(s=d+s),window[i]&&window[i].initialized)window[i].process&&window[i].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var a=e.createElement(t);a.async=1,a.id=n,a.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(a,o)}}(document,"script","infogram-async","https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js");</script></p>
<p>We expect that this balance will shift, as deal size in the lower middle market has remained steadier than other middle-market segments (-1.6% as opposed to -2.3% and -3.6% for the core and upper-middle markets, respectively).</p>
<p>As <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/q1-2018-restaurant-merger-acquisition">dry powder continues to grow</a> and competition for deals becomes fiercer, the lower middle market can offer safe harbor for private equity firms’ investment. But not all lower middle-market opportunities provide the same benefits; fund managers should consult experts in the industry to assess which ones best align with the firm’s strategy.</p>
<h2>Lower Middle-Market Restaurants Have More Favorable Valuations Than Large Companies</h2>
<p>Looking at publicly traded restaurants in the US, we see that valuations and growth in the lower middle market are similar to those found in the rest of the middle-market segment and among large enterprises (valued above $1b), but growth in the LMM can happen more quickly.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-10816 size-full" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Lower-Middle-Market-Restaurant-Valuations.png" alt="Lower Middle Market Restaurant Valuations" width="974" height="645" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Lower-Middle-Market-Restaurant-Valuations.png 974w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Lower-Middle-Market-Restaurant-Valuations-350x232.png 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Lower-Middle-Market-Restaurant-Valuations-300x199.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Lower-Middle-Market-Restaurant-Valuations-768x509.png 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Lower-Middle-Market-Restaurant-Valuations-970x642.png 970w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Lower-Middle-Market-Restaurant-Valuations-500x331.png 500w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Lower-Middle-Market-Restaurant-Valuations-640x424.png 640w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Lower-Middle-Market-Restaurant-Valuations-187x124.png 187w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Lower-Middle-Market-Restaurant-Valuations-136x90.png 136w" sizes="(max-width: 974px) 100vw, 974px" /></p>
<p>Some of these big operations, like Shake Shack, Domino’s Pizza, and Chipotle have EV/EBITDA multiples in the twenties, but none comes close to Wingstop’s 37.4x valuation. These multiples simply price most investors out of deals. In contrast, the lower middle market offers a 10.1x median multiple, showing a large potential upside.</p>
<p>Further, the five publicly traded, lower middle-market restaurants in the US are growing their valuations fairly consistently, at a 6.7% CAGR over the last ten years. (The big spike in 2014 came from Kona Grill’s 27x valuation, which has since come down to 11x.)</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10817" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Lower-Middle-Market-Restaurants-Growth-Rate.png" alt="Lower Middle Market Restaurant Growth Rate" width="974" height="645" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Lower-Middle-Market-Restaurants-Growth-Rate.png 974w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Lower-Middle-Market-Restaurants-Growth-Rate-350x232.png 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Lower-Middle-Market-Restaurants-Growth-Rate-300x199.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Lower-Middle-Market-Restaurants-Growth-Rate-768x509.png 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Lower-Middle-Market-Restaurants-Growth-Rate-970x642.png 970w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Lower-Middle-Market-Restaurants-Growth-Rate-500x331.png 500w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Lower-Middle-Market-Restaurants-Growth-Rate-640x424.png 640w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Lower-Middle-Market-Restaurants-Growth-Rate-187x124.png 187w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Lower-Middle-Market-Restaurants-Growth-Rate-136x90.png 136w" sizes="(max-width: 974px) 100vw, 974px" /></p>
<p>The growth in the lower middle-market median valuations beat out both the core middle market and the largest ten foodservice operations, which includes mainstays like McDonald’s, Starbucks, and Yum! Brands, and the core middle market, which only grew 2.4% CAGR.</p>
<h2>Industry Experts Guide Private Equity Firms to the Best Investments</h2>
<p>Lower middle-market concepts are becoming an investment sweet spot: with valuations attesting to profitability and good growth rates, this segment should provide strong returns. Further, the smaller size of these enterprises makes their systems more dynamic, able to adapt more quickly than many larger businesses. In the restaurant industry, where quick-change consumer preferences can transform the market in a matter of months, speed is key.</p>
<p>Not many private equity firms are active in this segment — our estimates classify only one of the <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/q1-2018-restaurant-merger-acquisition">first quarter’s deals</a> in the lower middle market — which cuts down on competition among bidders.</p>
<p>But investing in small concepts can be tricky. Most lower middle-market restaurants are looking for private equity to expand into new markets, a complicated process that can surface a host of underlying issues.</p>
<p>Without careful planning, adding locations stretches an operation’s supply chain — both in terms of volume and geography — pushing costs up and profits down.</p>
<p>The expansion process also puts pressure on a restaurant chain’s executive team. This means they would likely welcome expert advice from their private equity partners, but they will also need much more active guidance from investors.</p>
<p>Before entering into a lower middle-market deal, fund managers should consult with industry experts who have handled both buy- and sell-side transactions. Restaurant consultants can guide private equity firms to promising small concepts, help judge the feasibility of an expansion plan, create unbiased models of future growth, and spot red and yellow flags in the operation.</p>
<p>Done correctly, investments in smaller concepts will not only deliver strong returns but also allow the private equity firm to participate in the excitement of delivering the next best thing to diners all over the country, if not the world.</p>
<p>Private equity firms now have a golden opportunity to enter this promising segment of the restaurant industry. But, as other investors catch on, valuations are likely to start going up, up, and up, just as we’ve seen them do across sectors.</p>
