				<p>Restaurant CEO priorities are shifting in 2020, and it makes sense given how quickly the consumer and competitive landscape are shifting as well as the introduction of new forces impacting the industry. Here, we round up ten factors influencing how leaders are evolving their views and approach.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>1. The Impact of the Coronavirus Crisis on the Restaurant Industry</h2>
<p>It’s amazing how fast the <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-industry-coronavirus">coronavirus crisis</a> moved and how transformative of an impact it made globally. In the <a href="https://aaronallen.com/restaurant-industry">restaurant industry</a>, certain pockets will be irreversibly changed.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Leisure and Hospitality industry (of which restaurants represent 73%)&nbsp; accounts for 16.5 million jobs in the U.S. alone. Safety is a priority in these scenarios, as many of these employees are on the front line and in contact with 170 million people each day (under normal circumstances). That said, a coordinated&nbsp;effort with the government will likely be necessary to help ensure that millions aren&#8217;t out of work indefinitely.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Some chains will be a leader in their response,&nbsp;but many operators will not be able to sustain 20%–50% revenue losses, even if&nbsp;they are able to secure debt. Large chains will have an easier time refinancing and working their way through debt and leverage that would be too difficult for the average independent to manage. The composition in the industry between chains and independents will move further in favor of the former.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The economic model of the restaurant will be re-thought in a way that makes it more viable in the longer term. This is most relevant for full-service restaurants and, in particular, <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/casual-dining-restaurant-chains-entering-dangerous-waters">low-price point casual-dining operators</a> who can’t keep up with the rapidly increasing cost of labor and rent. This is the area that will receive the biggest blow by the crisis, which will also result in massive layoffs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Activist Investors Hungry for Weak Prey</h2>
<p>Like a crocodile preparing to go after an antelope in the wild, activist investors are looking at the restaurant space with the hunger in their eyes.</p>
<p>Foodservice has significant growth potential and is relatively “recession-proof” (after all, people will always eat), though increased saturation and ensuing <a href="https://aaronallen.com/restaurant-trends">consumer trends</a> have resulted in plenty of companies — particularly&nbsp;<a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/casual-dining-restaurant-chains-entering-dangerous-waters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">casual dining operators</a>&nbsp;— struggling.</p>
<ul>
<li>Activists often concentrate on optimizing one core component of a business and removing what they think to be distractions from the primary offering.</li>
<li>Investors who can help re-prioritize focus away from quarter-to-quarter thinking and put more of a premium on longer-term performance (i.e. guest experience initiatives that may be an investment in the near-term that pays returns in years ahead) will be ultimately rewarded.</li>
<li>Ron Shaich, the former CEO of Panera Bread, was so frustrated by the focus on short-term performance in the public markets that Panera went private (it&#8217;s a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/aarondallen_in-re-appraisal-of-panera-ugcPost-6630263900241752064-_EQm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fascinating industry case study</a>, the history of which is captured here), and Shaich eventually created his own investment firm, Act III Holdings, with goals over intentionally longer holding periods.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Private Equity Has a New Trick: Public Company Activism</h2>
<p>Not all activist investors take the same approach, and lately, there are some that prefer to participate in working collaboratively with management — rather than criticizing executive teams — to propose cost-cuts and other optimization strategies.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pershing Square Capital, led by Bill Ackman, made an investment in Chipotle (NYSE: CMG) in 2016. He went on record saying the “company’s issues were all addressable through better operations and oversight” and worked hand-in-hand with management to make improvements to the business (though that was before Pershing Square’s influence was used in a not-so-friendly way to oust then-Co-CEO Steve Ells, Chipotle’s founder, from his post).</li>
<li>Hedge fund Arex Capital Management is in talks with Fiesta Restaurant Group (parent company of Taco Cabana and El Pollo Tropical) regarding strategy, operations, and corporate structure. When Arex disclosed an 8.5% stake, Fiesta shares rose by 4%.</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. Traditional Cost-Cutting Isn&#8217;t Cutting It Any More</h2>
<p>The low-hanging fruit has already been harvested across many restaurant systems (think reducing food waste, cutting labor hours, etc.), so implementing other purely cost-cutting strategies would lead to cutting bone and ultimately undermining both the guest and employee experience.</p>
<p>In our experience, we’ve seen that many investors believe the value comes from stripping out expenses — but sometimes this can lead to pulling the soul right out of the business in attempts to exorcise out the costs. Reinventing and reimagining&nbsp;<a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-cost-cutting-ideas-part-one" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cost optimization strategies</a>&nbsp;can help to find non-obvious areas to improve upon.</p>
<ul>
<li>In general, the restaurant industry has done very little to engineer improved labor strategies over the years. The agricultural and manufacturing sectors enhanced productivity with automation, setting a precedent for what could happen in the foodservice industry.</li>
<li>To offset the rapid rise in labor costs around the globe, more creative strategies will need to be employed to maintain margins, market share, and guest satisfaction scores.</li>
<li>A 2% increase in sales is equivalent to a 10% reduction in cost. Rather than focusing on only cost reduction strategies, enhancing&nbsp;<a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/what-to-do-when-sales-are-down" target="_blank" rel="noopener">efforts to grow sales</a>&nbsp;can be just as — if not more — impactful to the bottom line.</li>
</ul>
<h2>5. Smart Captains Have Set Sail for Foreign Shores</h2>
<p>The bulk of all foodservice industry growth over the next five years will come from&nbsp;international markets, and a significant share of top growth brands derive an increasing percentage of revenue from outside their home markets.</p>
<ul>
<li>Global foodservice revenue is expected to grow by more than $600b within the next 4 years, with the majority of it coming from outside North America.</li>
<li>A compelling story of&nbsp;<a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/the-challenges-of-international-restaurant-expansion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">international expansion</a>&nbsp;— coupled with effective&nbsp;<a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/earned-media-restaurant-high-valuation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned media strategy</a>&nbsp;— can drive valuation multiples.</li>
<li>Four-walls operating margins can be as much as twice what the same brand may earn in a more mature foodservice environment, largely because the cost of labor is significantly lower in emerging markets.</li>
</ul>
<h2>6. Outsourcing and Rationalizing Corporate Headcount</h2>
<p>The C-suite is not recalculating or computing as fast as the variables of the calculus are changing. While it may cost more on a unit-by-unit basis, outsourcing efforts can be far more efficient than traditional models.</p>
<p>And a lot more factors are in play in this era of the gig economy as more and more companies (and individuals) are becoming accustomed to the fast, flexible, and outcomes-focused environment where it’s easier to scale and replace roles as needed. In some cases, this can help to optimize resources and shift risks (pensions, labor unions, taxes, insurance, administrative burden) if you pay enough to keep mercenaries.</p>
<ul>
<li>Marco’s Pizza separated the franchising department into a new company (Marco’s Franchised Services). The spin-off revenue is derived from a share of franchise sales, royalties, and initial investment.</li>
<li>Luby’s (the parent to Luby’s Cafeteria and Fuddruckers) is outsourcing some corporate systems including accounting, payroll, and operations analytics.</li>
<li>Wendy’s outsourced its IT department to a third party, who will deal mainly with digital initiatives. Currently, digital represents 2% of sales, and that’s expected to multiply by 5x within five years.</li>

				<h2>7. New CEO? Probably a New HQ.</h2>
<p>The easiest way to clear a forest is a controlled brush fire. Companies taking an “out with the old” mentality and growing are often moving headquarters to support scalability and long-term growth, housing all functional areas under one roof, as well as looking to attract the best talent.</p>
<ul>
<li>In 2019, Wingstop moved to new headquarters to be able to support scalability and long-term growth.</li>
<li>In 2018, Chipotle relocated to California (consolidating offices from two locations) only a few months after a new CEO was appointed.&nbsp;</li>
<li>McDonald’s linked their move to Chicago with improving performance (by being closer to customers and trends) and better access to talent.</li>
<li>After re-franchising (to only 8% corporate stores), CKE Restaurants consolidated Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s headquarters into a smaller one in 2016.</li>
<li>After being acquired, Bravo Brio moved headquarters in 2018 with the goal of attracting the best talent.</li>
</ul>
<h2>8. &#8220;We&#8217;re On Top Of It&#8221; Is Catching Up with Us</h2>
<p>There’s a Jedi mind trick happening, with operators hearing about advanced analytics, or the influence of automation, the impact of delivery, or the intensity of challenger brands.</p>
<p>Many executives are seemingly calm on the outside, with an “uh-huh, we’re on it” response (either that or a dismissive “we’ve already missed it”). This demeanor is starting to catch up with CEOs who staked their credibility on guiding the company into the future now working with antiquated anecdotes and antidotes of managing the business of yesterday.</p>
<ul>
<li>At the NRA Show in 2009, executive team members of both Buffalo Wild Wings and Chipotle announced they were taking a “wait-and-see” approach to social media. In hindsight, it’s flabbergasting. And the pace of change has only been increasing since (and will continue to do so).</li>
<li>Infamously, the former CEO of Blockbuster said that &#8220;neither RedBox nor Netflix are even on the radar screen in terms of competition&#8221; in 2008 — just two years before the company went bankrupt, largely due to the performance of those exact competitors.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h2>9. &#8220;Everything Important Is Measurable&#8221; Takes on a New Meaning</h2>
<p>With digital footprints now able to track nearly everything (and we mean&nbsp;<em>everything</em>) we do or say, transparency, accountability, historical analytical capabilities, and more intense corporate governance and expectations of the fiduciary very well may lead to rolling heads and executive compensation clawbacks. Golden parachutes increasingly have a tendency to be revoked after the CEO has already jumped (or been thrown) out of the plane.</p>
<p>The benefit of hindsight may reveal that executives may have been (intentionally or not) duping their boards into believing the right KPIs were being tracked.</p>
<p>Improved back-office systems can give leaders a meaningful and real-time view of the metrics that matter most. Paired with diagnostic systems that continually find and fix performance drains, these dashboards can become the most powerful weapon in the executive’s armory.</p>
<h2>10. Killed or Catapulted by Labor Models and Modernization</h2>
<p>Once the low-hanging fruit has been harvested, like a centrifuge the G-force is going to separate out those companies optimizing labor and those that don’t. For the foodservice industry, this is going to be the biggest brick of all; the net that’s going to catch the most companies hoping to swim to success.</p>
<p>For now, ahead of the sharp rise in labor costs, restaurants have maintained some degree of normalized EBITDA through price increases and been helped greatly by lower food costs, stabilized occupancy costs, low cost of capital, and some early wins with delivery and&nbsp;<a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/technology-in-restaurants" target="_blank" rel="noopener">technology initiatives</a>. However, looking into the future, labor optimization and modernization require reinvention, reimagining, and dramatically different thinking.</p>
<h2>11. Pressure-Test Your P&amp;L</h2>
<p>Every restaurant bleeds; it’s just a matter of where and how much. An objective analysis of the business — ranging from policies, procedures, processes, and applying theories of industrial engineering — to pressure-test the P&amp;L can help identify the potential for opportunity via optimization strategies across functional areas of the business.</p>
<p>A business need not be for sale to look at it through the lens of a potential investor and apply the kind of thought process employed by high-performance advisors who prestigious private equity firms turn to when diligencing businesses on the buy-side.</p>
<h2>So What Can CEOs Do in the Face of Evolution?</h2>
<ol>
<li><i><b>Be Your Own Activist</b></i>, or find one to help you identify vulnerabilities before someone else does</li>
<li><b><i>Share the Load</i></b>&nbsp;of the <a href="https://aaronallen.com/restaurant-strategy">strategy-shaping</a> diagnostic and analytical work, knowing that better questions get better answers&nbsp;</li>
<li><b><i>Realize that Asking for an Objective Opinion isn’t a Sign of Weakness</i></b><strong>,&nbsp;</strong>that’s just the ego-centric machoism style of thinking yesterday’s leaders were indoctrinated with</li>
</ol>
<p>Relying primarily on the&nbsp;<a href="https://aaronallen.com/restaurant-research" target="_blank" rel="noopener">corporate intelligence</a>&nbsp;that resides solely within your own organization is like relying on a radar system that tracks only your planes and troupe movements. And if you’re too busy to think much about any of these factors,&nbsp;<a href="https://aaronallen.com/contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hire someone else to</a>.</p>					</div>

				<p>We&#8217;ve worked with executive leadership teams of some of the most successful established and emerging foodservice and hospitality companies around the world, supporting with <a href="https://aaronallen.com/restaurant-strategy">strategic issues</a> related to growth and expansion, performance optimization, brand strategy, marketing, due diligence, and how to enhance and maintain enterprise value.</p>
<p>Through more than 2,000 senior-level engagements, we&#8217;ve consolidated some insights related to the most pressing questions our clients come to us with looking for answers, and the biggest challenges that we help them tackle.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a compilation of some of the most helpful how-tos related to the restaurant industry:</p>
<h2><a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/what-to-do-when-sales-are-down" style="color: #002c40;">1. How To Reverse Declining Revenues</a></h2>
<p>There’s a persistent, nagging feeling that comes with negative sales and traffic declines. In the restaurant industry, that feeling is amplified. Some might console themselves with the thought that it’s not all bad but, for those ready to face the facts of negative sales — and work to overcome them — there are a few steps to take before heading in the right direction. Here’s&nbsp;<a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/what-to-do-when-sales-are-down">what to do when restaurant sales are down</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/earned-media-restaurant-high-valuation" style="color: #002c40;">2. How to Enhance Enterprise Value with Earned Media</a></h2>
<p>Earned media can be a tool to demonstrate that valuation multiples can actually be increased throughout a holding period. Those looking to invest in a company naturally should be assured that there’s an opportunity to grow the business. That opportunity becomes more clear when an investor can say, “People are talking about this — <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/earned-media-restaurant-high-valuation">just think of all that you could do with it.</a>”</p>
<h2><a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-brand-refresh" style="color: #002c40; text-decoration-line: underline; outline: 0px;">3. How to Reinvigorate a Tired Restaurant Brand</a></h2>
<p>Most established restaurant chains have weathered difficult times, as customers started disappearing and sales slipped. Those that survived the slump did so by&nbsp;<a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-brand-refresh">realigning their brand</a>&nbsp;so its core personality, promise, and positioning resonated with guests.</p>
<h2><a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/how-to-reduce-restaurant-food-cost" style="color: #002c40;">4. How to Reduce Food Cost Responsibly</a></h2>
<p>Is your menu properly aligned with existing and emerging consumer dining behaviors and trends that could impact purchase price, frequency, check average, and product preferences? Have you conducted a menu mix, daypart mix, and profit center mix analysis to identify potential opportunities in the last six months? More questions to <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/how-to-reduce-restaurant-food-cost">help optimize food costs</a> here.</p>
<h2><a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-labor-optimization-strategies" style="color: #002c40;">5. How to Optimize Labor Productivity</a></h2>
<p>Rising wages are expected to be one of the biggest business stories in 2019 and beyond — particularly in the restaurant industry. Forward-looking operators can start to get ahead of the evolving trend by implementing <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-labor-optimization-strategies">labor optimization initiatives</a> now (before they become a necessity).</p>
<h2><a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/menu-engineering-margins" style="color: #002c40;">6. How to Improve Margins Through Menu Strategy</a></h2>
<p>Operating margins are being compressed for restaurants and foodservice operators around the world. But the choice between driving revenue and improving margins does not have to be binary — both can be achieved while catching a wider net of <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/menu-engineering-margins">performance enhancements.&nbsp;</a></p>
<h2><a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/launching-a-new-menu" style="color: #002c40;">7. How to Launch a New Menu Successfully</a></h2>
<p>Every great restaurant turnaround has started with a menu, working from the inside out. Yet, new menu launches are often relegated to junior teams and mired in committee consensus. In actuality, new menus affect every facet of a restaurant company — from food costs to company culture. We outline some of the questions that restaurants <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/launching-a-new-menu">launching a new menu</a> should, but often don’t, consider.</p>
<h2><a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-brand-identity-crisis" style="color: #002c40;">8. How to Evaluate the Effectiveness of Brand Strategy</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes, we are too close to our own unique skills, capabilities, advantages, and competencies to see how best to organize and harness them in business and brand strategy. It is key to find and leverage differentiated messaging and positioning that translates to a wealth of benefits (consumer appeal, competitive proposition, market share gains, revenue growth, sustainable margins, attracting better talent, and more). Learn more about how to <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-brand-identity-crisis">assess your brand strategy</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-marketing-audit" style="color: #002c40;">9. How to Perform a Marketing Audit</a></h2>
<p>In today&#8217;s era of a rapidly increasing pace of change, many chains fail to perform periodic, top-to-bottom audits of their marketing objectives, strategies, and activities. It can be difficult to narrow the focus. Those who perform <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-marketing-audit">marketing audits</a> shouldn&#8217;t just be able to answer &#8220;What are we doing?&#8221; but also &#8220;What should we stop doing?&#8221; and &#8220;What will we need to do in the future?</p>
<h2><a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-brand-audit" style="color: #002c40;">10. How to Evaluate Your Restaurant Brand Relevance</a></h2>
<p>“Relevance” has a deeper, broader meaning in today’s market than the traditional logos or slogans of yesterday. Similarly, a modern restaurant brand audit requires much more than just auditing a company’s marketing efforts. <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-brand-audit">These questions</a> will help you assess whether your branding is working — and if not, how to update it.</p>
<h2><a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/preparing-for-private-equity-restaurant-investment" style="color: #002c40;">11. How to Prepare for Private Equity Investment</a></h2>
<p>Private equity has increasingly found a niche in the restaurant industry, with deals cropping up on every continent. As our firm has been approached by between $3b–$4b in buy-side private equity specifically earmarked for actionable foodservice transactions, we put together an overview of the deal process to get a <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/preparing-for-private-equity-restaurant-investment">chained restaurant operation transaction-ready</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/technology-in-restaurants" style="color: #002c40;">12. How to Garner Buy-In for Technology Investments</a></h2>
<p>The foodservice organizations that have most successfully harnessed technology share a few attributes. They started their transformations while facing significant threats. The technological answers they implemented focused on improving the guest experience, not enacting change for its own sake. And their secret was not to champion technology, but to <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/technology-in-restaurants">champion change</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-marketing-budget-approved-ceo" style="color: #002c40;">13. How to Get Your Marketing Budget Approved</a></h2>
<p>Not only do the number of channels available for marketing grow every year, as social media platforms pop up overnight and then disappear just as quickly (still miss you, Vine!), but new technologies — like narrowcasting, smartphone apps, and self-ordering kiosks — all demand their own approach. Unfortunately, most restaurant marketing departments haven&#8217;t seen a thorough upgrade since 2009: the equivalent of walking around with an iPhone 3G in your pocket. Here’s <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-marketing-budget-approved-ceo">how to get your marketing budget (and initiatives) approved</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurants-looking-to-expand" style="color: #002c40;">14. How to Prepare for Rapid Expansion</a></h2>
<p>Growing too quickly can sometimes be egged on by the ego-over-EBITDA disposition of an unbridled management team. And not growing fast enough is a recipe for a different kind of disaster. While we often say it’s easier to ride a wild stallion (in this case, a fast-growing restaurant chain) than drag a dead horse (one that’s not growing at all) — the big question that many restaurant chains need to answer is: <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurants-looking-to-expand">how fast should we be growing?</a>&nbsp;And, what steps do we need to take to make sure we’re right-sizing our business along with that growth?</p>
<h2><a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-strategic-planning" style="color: #002c40;">15. How to Get Corporate Planning Right</a></h2>
<p>Global foodservice is a $3.1t industry, and it’s expected to grow at a relatively predictable pace with population, inflation, and consumer discretionary spending. But, over the next three to five years, hundreds of billions of dollars within the industry are going to shift to new categories and segments. We offer five tips to restaurant executives for rethinking <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-strategic-planning">strategic planning</a> to stay ahead of these changes and the competition.</p>					</div>

				<h3><em>They say the best way to grow mushrooms is to keep them in the dark and feed them manure. Some restaurant boards are relegated to the same regimen.</em></h3><p>While it is essential for the restaurant board of directors and executive management teams to nurture a harmonious and balanced relationship — and this is how it works in most of the best-run businesses — there are also instances of an organizational culture where board members become complacent in being treated like mushrooms (kept in the dark and fed a shovel-load of manure that masquerades as meaningful answers to serious strategic questions). </p><h3><strong>Finding the balance between a contentious and complicit discussion at the board-level can be challenging to get just right. </strong></h3><p>It has steadily become even more challenging in the face of heightened corporate governance concerns and risks that have been consistently elevated for the last two decades. However, it’s complicated even further by just how fast <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-innovation">disruptive forces</a> are emerging that require board-level attention; coupled with the fact a board has limited time (and, often, attention span) yet the complexity of some of these issues demand more technical understanding than can be represented on the board or executive management team. </p><p>What happens, naturally, is that those heavy board binders become checked luggage and the need to streamline and simplify a message often leads to an over-simplification of the strategic issues, management responses, and a decoupling of decision logic. Over time, this drift in understanding of the underlying root symptoms and causes leads to a more serious misalignment that requires dramatic course correction (you’ve seen this recently with C-suite departures, <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-investors">activist investors</a> making a stink, boardroom fights spilling out into public view, <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/stunning-examples-of-restaurant-enterprise-value-enhancements">enterprise values</a> of once strong companies evaporating like deflating rafts, etc.). </p><p><span style="color: #666666; font-size: 1.25rem;">So how can a restaurant board</span><span style="color: #666666; font-size: 1.25rem;"> of directors and management team find the right balance between placating and abdicating?</span></p><div><p>Any meaningful relationship and endeavor worthy of significant effort starts with <a href="https://aaronallen.com/restaurant-research">asking great questions</a> and caring about the answers. It requires a shared understanding about where things have been, where they are, and where they are headed (in consulting-speak, we call this historical state, current state, and future state).</p><p>In terms of a restaurant board of directors and an esteemed executive management team navigating complex issues — ranging from topics of corporate governance to emerging consumer dining behaviors; from shareholder returns to the sizzle of the steak; from the implications of 5G technology to the merits 3G’s zero-based budgeting strategy — the stark new reality that must be embraced is that simplification is something the marketing department must achieve (with external messaging), not something to aspire to (for internal meaning) in a board-level discussion these days.</p><p>Many of the questions are familiar, but the answers (even if they are the same, too) should be proven out to be based on updated intelligence, assumptions, and corporate calculus. </p></div><h2>Here are 10 questions for the modern-day restaurant board of directors and executive management teams:</h2><ol><li>What are we all thinking about but not talking about as the senior-most leaders of the company?</li><li>How will the consumer and competitive landscape change in the future? How are we preparing?</li><li>How did the consumer and competitive landscape change? How well did we predict it previously?</li><li>Are we doing the right things with strategic capital allocations (dividends, buybacks, tech, etc.)?</li><li>If we were to obsolete ourselves, how would we do it? How would we catapult past competition?</li><li>If you were chairman/CEO for the competition, what would you do to bring us to our knees?</li><li>Are we in the right markets with the right brands and formats? How can we better optimize here?</li><li>What should we acquire, divest, create, grow, and shrink in terms of our portfolio? Any M&amp;A?</li><li>What’s happening both inside and outside the business in terms of reputational signals?</li><li>Is there another voice or point of view we should hear-out here that we can invite in the next quarter?</li></ol><h2>The best questions a board could ask themselves (one-on-one, not in a group dynamic):</h2><ol><li>What questions are we not asking that we should be asking?</li><li>If we could change anything about our recorded past or predicted future, what would it be? Why?</li><li>Which authorizations or approvals have we been hesitant to ask about?</li><li>What are we underfunding or underinvesting, both in terms of current business and potential?</li><li>What complaints and criticisms do we hear most often that others are afraid to discuss?</li></ol><h2>A few tips we’ve picked up on along the way (from experience that has shaped our view):</h2><ul><li>There’s a difference between diligence and discourteous distraction</li><li>Managing a restaurant board of directors can be like herding cats (if instead of cats they were tigers)</li><li>The shortest answer isn’t always the best answer, even if it’s the preferred response</li><li>Nuance can make a career and catapult an executive; it can also kill a company</li><li>A charismatic C-suite exec can charm a board and company into a hard nail coffin</li><li>Every quarter counts, but it’s not what should count most</li><li>Sometimes bad leaders get great roles (and great ideas get a bad rap)</li><li>Sometimes bad ideas gain enthusiastic consensus (but later fail on the logic and merits)</li><li>Corporate strategy can’t be the child of complacency; consensus needn’t be complicit</li></ul><p>We’ve all been on the ‘right’ (even righteous) and the wrong side of these themes before in our careers. Many of us have had an exposure to the best and worst of politically charged environments, social chutes-and-ladders, and dealt with the consequence of distilling a career of experience down to a soundbite that either resonated or rang our own bells; scarred a psyche, scratched a reputation, or put a dent, for better or worse, in a worldview.  </p><p>A lesson taught early in my life and career is that while youth comes with the strong sense that issues are black or white, experience trains us that nearly every issue really resides somewhere in the spectrum of gray.</p><p>The questions here are about balance and harmony of a board and the C-suite (without sacrificing competitiveness of a company or surrendering its strategy to the social skills of a well-heeled executive potentially elevated for how well they smooth over the salient issues that deserve a deeper dive).</p><h3><em><strong>Dear Fox, how are things at the hen house? Great! Couldn&#8217;t be better. Here’s my report. </strong></em></h3><p>A board member basing decisions and authorizations on a 5-page summary is like a movie critic evaluating a film based on the trailer edited and screened specifically for critics (or a fox giving the farmer a report about how things are going down at the hen house).</p><h3><strong><em>The counter-point? Trust management. Champion their concerns and course of action. </em></strong></h3><p>For all of the talk of how boards should be more personally accountable, scrutinize, and search below the surface-level of strategy for true proof-points, the fact of the matter is that most executive management teams are really on top of things (as scared as anyone about getting it right and as desirous as anyone about sure-footedness in doing so).</p><h3><strong><i>Back to the Top: Balance</i></strong></h3><p>A restaurant board of directors that second-guesses every step of executive management runs the risk of teaching those entrusted with the enterprise of sheepishly (or sleazily) seeking to appease the whims of debutants and blowhards aroused by the force of their own breath. A board of directors that allows oversimplified explanations to suffice puts at risk not only shareholders but every stakeholder that has or is willing to sacrifice on behalf of a greater good.</p><h2><strong>What’s the right answer?</strong></h2><p>The right question and the right answer: are we doing our homework as well or better than anyone else in our class? Are we winning on merit or entitlement? Are we focused on the next quarter or how to achieve top-quartile performance years ahead (keeping up with or leapfrogging our competition and even our own capabilities)?</p><p>A company (and shareholders/critics) that measures performance quarterly is akin to a parent that decides the fate of an infant child based solely on how well it can walk today, without concern or consideration for how fast it might run tomorrow.</p><p>Every great contributor to a company and society is both a teacher and a student. The best boards of directors also exemplify this quality and characteristic — both teaching and learning; both global and granular in perspective and point of view; willing to keep things at a high-level but understanding that a rapidly shifting competitive landscape coupled by an oversimplification of strategic imperatives can make for a comfortable quarterly board meeting, but can cripple the long-term potential of a company.</p><h2>The Beauty of a Board is Found in the Difference of its Individual Members’ Experiences and Perspectives</h2><p>Differences, not similarities. Ultimately an alignment and consensus must be reached,  but that is best reached through respectfully challenging one another. The greater danger for most boards today is dismissiveness, not lack of decisiveness. Far too many board members are content to chase answers like skipping stones chase purpose  — four showy splashes and then sink from view and utility.</p><p>A board and executive team today must balance congeniality with competitive fortitude; mutual respect with mutual accountability; simplicity without oversimplifications; and must arrive at how to best deliver short-term gains while focused on achieving exceptional long-term yields and shareholder returns. Wow. It’s a lot. It’s little wonder why so few companies get it right. But, the ones that do, my how we all love to applaud their accomplishment (even if what it required wasn’t as easy to appreciate from above the surface-level view of their sacrifice and contribution)</p>					</div>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While we often say it’s easier to ride a wild stallion (in this case a fast-growing restaurant chain) than drag a dead horse (one that’s not growing at all) — the big question that many restaurant chains need to answer is: how fast should we be growing?  And what steps do we need to take to make sure we’re right-sizing our business along with that growth?</p>
<p>As a consultancy that’s top-line oriented and often supports companies with growth and expansion, we usually want to take a very optimistic view to help enable the most ambitious aspirations our clients may have. But, on occasion, a company comes along with plans that are completely ungrounded with reality. In those cases, we view it as our responsibility to help recalibrate expectations.</p>
<p>Many restaurant companies (especially startups and emerging brands) have more-than-aggressive expansion plans. We’ve seen some aim at opening 300+ restaurants in two- or three-year time-frames while having an existing footprint of just a handful of locations. It begs the question: is that feasible? Reasonable? Practical?</p>
<h2>Right-Sizing for Expansion</h2>
<p>For all of the positive case studies (the Chipotles of the world), there are plenty of others who had the same goals but fell short on executing them. Pinkberry, Blimpie’s, Dickie’s, Moe’s, Quizno’s. The list of brands that were expecting to take the industry by storm — but fizzled out — goes on.</p>
<p>Successful expansion requires more than <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-strategic-planning">strategic planning</a> — it’s also the calculus of right-sizing to be able to support the business through its growth. Like a child who’s constantly outgrowing clothes so parents buy them a few sizes up to “grow into,” a rapidly expanding business is often at a point of either being under-supported with infrastructure or having systems (or people) too advanced for the current operations.</p>
<h2>Advantages of Rapid Growth</h2>
<p>Growth is one of the best indicators of positive performance. Some of the benefits of rapid expansion include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gaining market share and making land grabs in new or emerging concepts and categories</li>
<li>Excitement and enthusiasm from the media and additional publicity (leading to positive impact on valuations)</li>
<li>Efficiencies and economies of scale</li>
<li>Opportunities to engineer potentially redundant costs out from operations via hub-and-spoke or commissary models</li>
<li>Attracting more team members, partners, suppliers, and investors who want to be involved or associated with the brand</li>
</ul>
<h2>Potential Risks of Growing Too Fast</h2>
<p>Wild claims about growth have been made plenty of times, but because of dismissiveness or lack of operations-based projections, few are able to grow at rates above 35%. Some of the risks companies can face include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Challenges of right-sizing infrastructure (including people, process, technology, etc.), and outgrowing the capabilities of existing resources</li>
<li>Supply chain pressures and ensuring availability and consistency of product</li>
<li>Real estate pipelines and securing good locations</li>
<li>Seeding new markets (creating exposure and awareness)</li>
<li>Human resources hiring, onboarding, enculturation, and managing corporate culture</li>
<li>Potentially overpaying to compensate speeding up slow parts of the system</li>
<li>Tough comps leading to stalling or not achieving consistent growth, potentially damaging brand reputation</li>
</ul>
<h2>Aspiring is One Thing, Assuming to Better the Best is Another</h2>
<p>Starbucks has become the second-largest foodservice brand in the world in terms of sales and is also one of the fastest-growing. At the end of 2016, the company announced a plan to open 12,000 new locations by 2021 — increasing store count by 48%. That growth amounts to about 2,400 locations per year. Or, even more impressively, an average of 6.5 stores each day.</p>

<p>Using that metric, it could be easy for smaller organizations to see growth targets of a few hundred locations as more than achievable. But Starbucks has put in more than 40 years of building infrastructure to support this level of growth (or even something remotely close to it). They’re starting from a rock-solid foundation, not a handful of units.</p>
<h2>A Case Study: The Fast-Casual Pizza Segment</h2>
<p>Fast-casual pizza broke onto the scene and grew rapidly. (In 2015, 9 of the top 25 fastest-growing restaurant chains were in this category.) There’s a large potential for it in the U.S. market — where the bulk of pizza sales are delivery and often at a lower quality — so there was plenty of capital available to fund expansion.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-13532 aligncenter" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/restaurants-looking-to-expand-Pie-Five-case-study.png" alt="restaurants looking to expand Pie Five case study" width="789" height="525" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/restaurants-looking-to-expand-Pie-Five-case-study.png 789w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/restaurants-looking-to-expand-Pie-Five-case-study-350x233.png 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/restaurants-looking-to-expand-Pie-Five-case-study-300x200.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/restaurants-looking-to-expand-Pie-Five-case-study-768x511.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 789px) 100vw, 789px" /></p>
<p>Many brands tried to grab the land very quickly, particularly with a franchise model. But then confidence started to wane, and a number of locations closed up as fast as they opened, with many concepts putting on the brakes. Pie Five, for instance, more than doubled between 2014–2015 but has closed 15 units (17% of its system) since 2016. This is one example of expansion happening too fast, and both individual units and the brand as a whole paying the price.</p>
<h2>What to Consider When Planning for Rapid Expansion</h2>
<p>For organizations that are growing quickly, it’s easy to outpace the infrastructure in place. This can include everything from finding locations, to building a pipeline of people, to supply chain constraints, to the demands of supporting franchisees. (<a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/the-challenges-of-international-restaurant-expansion">International expansion</a> adds even more layers of complexity.)</p>
<p>Often, growth targets are simply disconnected from the reality of what it takes to support a sustainable foodservice enterprise. Some fast-growing companies can require as much as a quarter per dollar in revenue growth in additional costs or capital requirements at a corporate level to ramp up in advance growth and pipelining. We recommend modeling conservative, base, and ambitious cases to compare scenarios and associated investments.</p>

<p>Organizations can work on <a href="https://aaronallen.com/restaurant-finance">financial models</a> for months without factoring in the operational constraints that very well may mean the plans on paper border on impossible. We’ve heard these stories and reviewed pro forma hundreds of times and, sadly the case, very few companies actually make good on those projections.</p>
<h2>Right-Sizing Growth Targets Increases Confidence While Reducing Risk</h2>
<p>We caution our clients — both foodservice operators and investors — to beware of promising or planning for expansion targets that would be the equivalent of outpacing some of the fastest-growing concepts in half the time.</p>
<p>Making and breaking promises often leads to damaging the perception of a brand for consumers and investors alike. Right-sizing growth targets based on operational models brings additional sensitivity to planning and pays off through enhanced confidence in projections and performance.</p>
<p>For restaurants looking to expand, it&#8217;s not necessarily about how fast they <em>can </em>grow, rather how fast they <em>should </em>grow to deliver for all stakeholders involved.</p>

However, it is also certainly moving and worth the time to remind restaurant executives ascribed to servient leadership that the road is often long and thankless for all committed to contributing in a meaningful way. It’s not about small and short-term payoffs. It’s about setting an example that eventually wins not only hearts and minds but also makes a difference that lasts in a company or community and ripples out far wider than may be imagined when putting in the hard work day to day.</p>					</div>

				<h2>2. We Are All Connected</h2><p>There’s always plenty of both good and bad going on around the world — some markets are up or down, certain categories are performing stronger than others, and there are always plenty of demands. By being proactive and realizing the things within our world and industry that are challenging, great leaders ask of great minds, “What’s wrong?” And, more importantly, “What can we do about it?” The creators of the video below did just that.</p><p>What they discovered, through conversations with scientists, philosophers, and spiritual leaders, is that we’re more interconnected than it may seem.

				<h2>3. The Power of Recognition</h2><p>One of the great restaurant leaders to herald for accomplishments and contributions to the industry is David Novak (former CEO of Yum!, serving from 1999 to 2016). In 2016, he released a book called <em>O Great One! </em>that highlights the great power in recognition — and what it means for those in your downstream. The butterfly effect of recognizing individuals within an organization also carries through to the guests those employees are interacting with. Imagine the power of this sentiment carrying through your organization.</p>					</div>

				<p>For us in the United States, the Thanksgiving holiday is when we pause each year to reflect on who has made the most meaningful and important contributions to our lives. What may seem small at the time can be of great significance to others. In the spirit of the season, here are some of the things, people, and experiences we’re most thankful for in 2018.</p><h3>Our Community on LinkedIn</h3><p>We’re very grateful, honored, and excited to have been included in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6468133406810140672/">LinkedIn’s Top Voices for 2018</a>. The editors have named us the most important voice in the global foodservice industry on the world’s largest professional networking platform. We’re grateful to both the editors and to you for engaging in the content.</p><h3>Our Experiences in MENA</h3><p>November 2018 also marks 10 years to the month of our firm being active in MENA. Among the many things we’ve learned in that time is just how generous and kind the people are. We recently traveled to Dubai to host executive leadership of some of the most recognized industry contributors in the region. It was an opportunity to acknowledge appreciation to clients and admiration to industry leaders. It was also an opportunity to express gratitude for the many expressions of kindness that many in the room helped create or shape.</p><h3>Our Industry</h3><p>Every year, we count ourselves lucky that we work in an industry that holds the values of care, compassion, empathy and trust in such high regard. We’re grateful that our passion and profession are one and the same and that we spend our time amplifying the work of inspiring leaders who are moving their organizations and the industry in exciting and powerful new directions.</p>					</div>

				<p>Many restaurant executive teams are still planning with post-it notes and ballpoint pens while their competitors are harnessing theories, tools, and techniques that sound like science fiction — big data, machine learning, artificial intelligence, behavioral economics, neuromarketing — to create strategy and allocate budgets.</p><p>For far too long, planning has consisted of dusting off last year’s templates and marking up financial projections by 3%. Always doing what’s always been done — which means always getting what’s always been got — is increasingly dangerous.</p><p>Today, market share gains most commonly come from stealing from someone else, and last year’s playbook is already archived in competitors’ best practices documents. A third of organizations are moving so slowly that they can’t seize new opportunities or mitigate emerging threats.</p><p>Most companies recognize that the old approaches to planning are insufficient and need to catch up with the pace of change in technology and consumer dining behavior.</p><p>Don’t get left behind this strategic planning season. Here are five tips for purposeful planning:</p><h2>1. Develop Rolling 36-Month Plans</h2><p>No one can see 10 years into the future. If we go back only five years, most people wouldn’t have been able to comprehend how fast the industry has changed. Moreover, most restaurant strategic planning processes have not kept up with the changes. Operations are often state of the art for 2009, not 2018.</p><p>While it’s not possible to predict the future, executive teams can increase the probability of success by understanding and watching the variables that may impact it. Though the pace of change has increased exponentially — and will continue to accelerate — companies who approach long-term planning with the belief that they have too much to worry about right now to look ahead will soon wake up with the realization that things have <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/10-trends-reshaping-the-restaurant-industry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changed faster outside the business than inside</a>.</p><p>We advocate a rolling 36-month plan. Short-term planning can create a tremendous amount of volatility, and recent political conversations have proposed doing away with <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-sec-trump/trump-asks-sec-to-mull-half-year-corporate-filings-vs-quarterly-idUSKBN1L217G">quarterly reporting</a> for publicly traded companies in an effort to increase stability. Incentivizing leaders with solely short-term targets might force executives to ignore longer-term opportunities for the business.</p><p>Of course, there are current-year initiatives that optimize performance by <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-cost-cutting-ideas-part-one">reducing cost</a>, improving efficiency, enhancing the guest experience, and <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/top-performer">building morale and buy-in</a>, but these should not be the sole focus of management teams.</p><p>The gains successful companies are getting now come from decisions made years — not months — back. <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/dominos-turnaround">Domino’s Pizza</a> stands out in particular. Patrick Doyle launched the transformation plan in 2010, and stock prices are continuing to grow. Starbucks, Panera, and McDonald’s each provide compelling cases as well.</p><p>The gap between the haves and have-nots can be traced to investments in systems, technologies, and planning informed by a robust understanding of the factors that will influence the future of foodservice, from mobile and automated technology to consumer preferences and new labor models.</p><h2>2. Ask Better Questions to Get Better Answers</h2><p>Many of the best practices of corporate strategy and annual planning hold true. Frameworks including PESTLE, SWOT, and Five Forces analysis as well as consumer trend research and understanding evolving dining behaviors still have a place in these discussions.</p><p>Many new ideas, from fully automated restaurants to dark kitchens serviced by mobile ordering apps, at first seem like the self-indulgent drivel of a corporate strategist. But these are real developments, and their impacts on our global industry can already be anticipated and, to some degree, forecasted. What may get eye rolls today will most likely make bankrolls tomorrow.</p><p>Though the kinds of questions posed by traditional frameworks remain useful and important, strategic planning should also include discussions around the forces reshaping the industry, such as:</p><ul><li>Should we make any changes to our portfolio (through acquisition, creation, or divesting)?</li><li>What new innovations fit best with our unique value proposition?</li><li>Are we making it as easy and frictionless for our customers to buy from us as possible?</li><li>How will the push for off-premise dining affect our business model?</li><li>How can we use technology to better connect with and service our guests?</li><li>How can we integrate blockchain and the Internet of Things into our supply chain?</li><li>How can developments in packaging make our organization more sustainable and environmentally friendly?</li><li>What are rivals — long-standing ones in our market and segment as well as start-ups and competition from other sectors — doing to try to claim our market share?</li></ul><p>The leaders of tomorrow have answers to these questions and are willing to make investments in projects that sound fantastical today. They recognize that the entirety of the foodservice industry is going to change and have already started not just keeping up with these developments but creating their own innovations that will push the industry further.</p><h2>3. Collaborate and Co-Author</h2><p>A visionary CEO needs support from every stakeholder and shareholder in the organization, and that begins with the board. More than half of executives credit the success of their strategic initiatives to buy-in and support from other senior leaders. </p><p>Unfortunately, it can be incredibly difficult to effectively communicate the urgency and opportunity presented by these kinds of investments, and such breakdowns in communication can become incredibly frustrating — and damaging. Ron Shaich experienced just this complication while bringing <a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-tech-investment">Panera 2.0</a> to life. Reading between the lines, it seems likely that he took the company private to avoid scrutiny from shareholders who preferred short-term performance to forward-looking investments.</p><p>Ultimately, Panera 2.0 saved customers a decade’s worth of waiting time. Even with case studies like these, Shaich still faced skepticism, and we see this dynamic play out in boardrooms all over the world. While companies recognize that shrinking sales and share mean they need to do something, short-term pressure and scoffing suspicions thwart potential innovations.</p><div> </div>					</div>

				<p>Eliminating cognitive biases — the desire to continue on the same path a company has tread for years — is facilitated by management teams presenting a comprehensive and compelling view of where the industry is headed. Gone are the days of Excel spreadsheets with inputs on cost of goods sold, commodity prices, and incremental sales gains are sufficient. They’ve been replaced with more sophisticated scenario modeling, real-time data collection to track historic and present performance and predictive analytics that forecasts into the future.</p><p>With these tools, the board and executive leadership can make more informed, long-term capital allocations that can be reviewed frequently and farther out than the traditional annual budgeting process allows.</p><h2>4. Resensitize to Innovation</h2><p>Much of bleeding-edge technology is so advanced that it can move from off the radar to the center of our lives at a pulse-quickening pace. Both mainstream media and trade publications are covering these developments, which sometimes counterintuitively diminishes their impact. Because we see so many headlines about artificial intelligence, big data, and automation, it’s easy to feel confident we know in everything there is to know about them.</p><p>Almost everyone would say that robotics and automation will become essential to maintaining performance in the QSR sector in terms of the unit economic model. The challenge is identifying those technologies that can be integrated into the existing business to enhance quality and the guest experience. This demands a thorough understanding of new technology to match the knowledge of current operations, and such a nuanced view requires a willingness to learn, experiment, and — most importantly — be moved by all the potential these innovations offer.</p>					</div>

				<p>Crew-level employees need to be learning new skills before they can be replaced by faster, cheaper, and more accurate robots. The kiosk will certainly replace the cashier, but a parallel can be drawn to the restaurant CEO who fails to learn new skills and keep up with the evolving industry.</p>
<p>Where it may have been a disqualifier before, paranoia may become a more sought-after trait among CEOs. And it’s most certainly the case for corporate strategists whose job it is to anticipate and help the company prepare to size, seize, and capitalize on that opportunity.</p>
<h2>5. Improve Internal Communication</h2>
<p>Any successful plan requires buy-in, and there’s a tremendous opportunity for companies to improve communication both among leaders and throughout the organization. Very few organizations would dispute the importance of communication, but most have cracks in their pipelines — 95% of a typical workforce doesn’t understand its organization’s strategy.</p>
<p>This begins with high-level discussions, where involving employees from all levels and functional areas could surface new approaches. Part of corporate planning should be dedicated to shooting for goals that are impossible by asking, &#8220;if it were possible, how would we do it?&#8221; When big ideas are presented this way, people begin to scrap steps and systems altogether and design entirely new ways of attacking the problem that allow for quantum leaps in productivity and performance.</p>
<p>Enrolling others in the discussion and decision-making process doesn’t do the whole job: there has to be communication both along the way and after. This is one of the biggest cracks that strategic plans fall through on their way to implementation — a dark crevasse where communication doesn’t happen. Only 42% of managers and 27% of employees get access to the strategic plan, which means that only a minority of an organization knows where the company is headed.</p>
<h2>Avoid Death by a Thousand Paper Cuts</h2>
<p>With a complete understanding of markets and how things are changing on a global, regional, and local basis, the ability to size, seize, and capitalize on new and emerging opportunities can help catapult a company over the competition faster than either organization knew possible.</p>					</div>

				<p>In fact, that’s part of what’s happening between direct competitors within the industry, as new entrants with emerging technologies (delivery aggregators, dark kitchens, food halls, meal delivery services, and so on) are stealing share in a way that may seem insignificant at first, like a papercut. One stings, but when enough cuts combine, it’s like losing a bucket of blood.</p><p>The global foodservice industry is a $2.7t industry, and it&#8217;s expected to grow at a relatively predictable pace (with population, inflation, and consumer discretionary spend). But, over the next three to five years, hundreds of billions of dollars of spend within the industry are going to shift to new categories and segments. This means that many of the existing companies are already restaurant zombies — dead, but they don’t know it yet.</p><p>The leaders who recognize, anticipate, and plan ahead of this new industrial revolution will not only avoid the fate of dying by a thousand cuts, but they also have the opportunity to contribute to and direct these innovations. It’s undeniable that the foodservice landscape will look radically different in even five years. But who will shape it?</p>					</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every organization has top talent, and finding and fostering those key players is critical to a company’s ability to thrive during both good and challenging times.</p>
<p>In the global foodservice industry, top contributors make themselves known in a variety of ways. They drive exceptional outputs, come up with new ideas, foster change in their organization, and deliver sustainable results.</p>
<p>Four qualities distinguish top performers:</p>
<ul>
<li>A relentless drive toward self-improvement</li>
<li>Trustworthiness and reliability</li>
<li>Intelligence and creativity</li>
<li>Willing to stand on principle</li>
</ul>
<p>Cultivating these traits is key to a successful operation, and executives can take a number of actions to encourage and develop these employees:</p>
<ul>
<li>Communicate a compelling set of values</li>
<li>Provide tools and resources to support associates</li>
<li>Engage crew-level employees in big initiatives</li>
<li>Tailor recognition to individuals</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Recognize Top Performers</h2>
<p>Not every key player in an organization contributes in the same way, but most:</p>
<h3>1. Top Contributors Push To Improve Themselves</h3>
<p>Top employees are competitive — with their peers, but also with themselves. They challenge themselves to do and be better, to refine and obtain new skills and experiences that will make them more valuable to their employer and colleagues.</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://www.archwaystoopportunity.com/">Archways to Opportunity</a> program run by McDonald’s and its independent franchisees, employees are empowered to expand their knowledge and capabilities, regardless of life stage. This includes polishing their English language skills, earning a high school diploma, and pursuing a college degree.</p>
<p>While the global chain offers employees the tools and infrastructure, it’s the focus, drive, and commitment inherent in the people who participate in this program that means only top performers seize this opportunity.</p>
<p><a href="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/McDonalds-Top-Performer.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11825 size-full" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/McDonalds-Top-Performer.jpg" alt="McDonalds Top Performer" width="1650" height="672" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/McDonalds-Top-Performer.jpg 1650w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/McDonalds-Top-Performer-350x143.jpg 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/McDonalds-Top-Performer-300x122-1.jpg 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/McDonalds-Top-Performer-768x313-1.jpg 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/McDonalds-Top-Performer-1024x417-1.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1650px) 100vw, 1650px" /></a></p>
<h3>2. Top Contributors Cultivate Trust</h3>
<p>Top talent can be counted on to deliver high-quality performance, consistent, strategic decisions, steady people management, backup in a pinch, and discretion. This level of reliability takes time to develop, but, once established, it’s priceless.</p>
<p>One notable global hospitality company — the Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company — has made trust the bedrock of its world-class customer service. The organization allows employees to make decisions in the best interest of guests in real time, using up to $2,000. No need to ask permission. No need to call a manager. Just solve the problem.</p>
<p>This model works because new employees undergo an intensive three-week training program, during which they work closely with a more experienced mentor. The hotel chain also has “just-in-time training,” activated if guest surveys or mystery shoppers report any concerns. The Ritz-Carlton’s commitment to training its staff not only ensures best-in-class customer service, but it also builds trust, honesty, respect, and integrity into every employee’s working experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Ritz-Top-Performer.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11824 size-full" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Ritz-Top-Performer.jpg" alt="Ritz Top Performer" width="1279" height="853" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Ritz-Top-Performer.jpg 1279w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Ritz-Top-Performer-350x233.jpg 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Ritz-Top-Performer-300x200-1.jpg 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Ritz-Top-Performer-768x512-1.jpg 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Ritz-Top-Performer-1024x683-1.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1279px) 100vw, 1279px" /></a></p>
<h3>3. Top Contributors Innovate</h3>
<p>While aptitude and expertise are critical to overall performance, the ability to innovate is what sets top contributors apart. These associates don’t just think outside the box, they don’t see a box. They anticipate the needs of the organization and its client base in an effort to stay ahead of the curve.</p>
<p>This fall, Starbucks will open its first Signing Store in the U.S., located in Washington, D.C. The unique store will promote accessibility, offering employment and career advancement for those who are deaf or hard of hearing. More significantly, the new location is the brainchild of by Deaf Starbucks partners and allies. After a Signing Store opened in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in 2016, American Deaf partners were inspired to advocate for a U.S. location.</p>
<p>Employees who drive innovation — from finding new ways of connecting with customers and solving complex problems to building the brand, and moving the business forward — exist in every company. The best leaders tap into that talent, locating and encouraging the individuals in their organization who are driven to realize positive change and have a lasting impact on the business as well as the diverse communities it serves.</p>

<h3>4. Top Contributors Put the Organization First</h3>
<p>Top contributors embrace the courage of their convictions, even when it’s uncomfortable. They focus on what’s right for the team and organization. While they recognize that they’re being paid to have — and communicate — an opinion, savvy top performers also pick their battles.</p>
<p>The ultimate display of professional principles is stepping away from a role. Though we might argue that he took too long to take action, <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/chipotle-ceo-steve-ells">Chipotle CEO Steve Ells’s</a> decision to step down in late 2017 after years of crises and criticism was ultimately the most mature and strategic move. It showed that he — with a nudge from activist investor Bill Ackman — put what was best for the company, its employees, customers, and shareholders first.</p>

<h2>How To Retain Top Performers</h2>
<p>Top performers contribute incredible value to an organization and are often batting away job offers, so it’s critical that leadership focus on recognizing and retaining them. The most effective way to keep key players is to ensure they know how to make an impact on the organization. Management teams should work to:</p>
<h3>1. Articulate a clear and compelling vision and set of values for the organization</h3>
<p>Top performers tend to be more skeptical than other employees, so they need to feel connected to something bigger than themselves and understand how they fit into the bigger picture.</p>
<p>sweetgreen – a QSR focused on simple and healthy food – leverages social and digital channels to clearly articulate its story, core values, and ambitious mission for impacting its associates, customers, and the communities it serves.</p>
<p>Potential and current employees can easily understand the persuasive “why” behind sweetgreen and draw the connection between their own role and the broader goals of this emerging foodservice brand.</p>
<p><a href="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/sweetgreen-top-performer.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11821 size-full" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/sweetgreen-top-performer.jpg" alt="sweetgreen top performer" width="1632" height="864" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/sweetgreen-top-performer.jpg 1632w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/sweetgreen-top-performer-350x185.jpg 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/sweetgreen-top-performer-300x159-1.jpg 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/sweetgreen-top-performer-768x407-1.jpg 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/sweetgreen-top-performer-1024x542-1.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1632px) 100vw, 1632px" /></a></p>
<h3>2. Provide the tools, resources, and working environment that helps associates perform at their highest and best level</h3>
<p>These efforts will vary across organizations and roles, but tailoring them to meet associates’ needs will encourage productivity and goodwill.</p>
<p>Viceroy Hotels, which operates luxury properties in North America, Latin America, the Caribbean, and Europe, turned to technology to make it easier for their employees to satisfy guest needs. No matter the department, every associate now wears a smart watch, which buzzes when a request comes through. The employee closest or most equipped to handle the situation taps their watch to let others know they are working on it.</p>
<p>As a sleek replacement to a walkie-talkie or phone, the smart watches won’t interrupt employees who are currently assisting guests, nor does it require them to stop what they’re doing to see what’s needed. This innovative solution shows a clear understanding of the challenges hotel employees face.</p>
<p><a href="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Viceroy-top-performers.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11820 size-full" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Viceroy-top-performers.jpg" alt="Viceroy top performers" width="1262" height="960" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Viceroy-top-performers.jpg 1262w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Viceroy-top-performers-350x266.jpg 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Viceroy-top-performers-300x228-1.jpg 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Viceroy-top-performers-768x584-1.jpg 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Viceroy-top-performers-1024x779-1.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1262px) 100vw, 1262px" /></a></p>
<h3>3. Include the best crew-level employees in strategic initiatives aimed at improving organizational competitiveness</h3>
<p>The people who contribute the most to an organization care about the future of the company. They like to see that its leaders are aligned with the changing demands of the industry and are aggressively planning to meet them.</p>
<p>Strategic committees are commonly perceived as additional duties assigned to high-potential associates, and Starwood Hotel &amp; Resorts leveraged such a group to address challenges in its underdeveloped food &amp; beverage program. Using both external and internal resources to elevate their approach to the program, Starwood created an innovative framework that consolidated food and beverage marketing programs across properties. The program was so successful that all internal participants were either promoted (or hired away into a higher role at another company) within approximately six months of launch.</p>
<p><a href="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Starwood-Top-Performer.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11819 size-full" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Starwood-Top-Performer.jpg" alt="" width="1220" height="814" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Starwood-Top-Performer.jpg 1220w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Starwood-Top-Performer-350x234.jpg 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Starwood-Top-Performer-300x200-1.jpg 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Starwood-Top-Performer-768x512-1.jpg 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Starwood-Top-Performer-1024x683-1.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1220px) 100vw, 1220px" /></a></p>
<h3>4. Tailor reward and recognition to individual contributors</h3>
<p>Not everyone wants to be recognized in the same way, and a personal touch will resonate with employees. If leaders show that they&#8217;re investment in their employees — and their successes — these associates will continue to invest in the team and the organization.</p>
<p>Like most multinational companies, Starbucks has a formal recognition framework for supporting and promoting its employees, including Partner of the Quarter, Anniversary Awards, and Performance Awards. An integral part of this system is the element of customization: when partners receive awards, they earn points that can be applied to merchandise, learning and development programs, and even opportunities to help their communities. Starbucks puts the power of choice in their partners’ hands, letting them decide how they want to be recognized. No risk, all reward.</p>
<p><a href="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Starbucks-top-performers-2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-11818 size-full" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Starbucks-top-performers-2.jpg" alt="Starbucks top performers 2" width="1146" height="764" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Starbucks-top-performers-2.jpg 1146w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Starbucks-top-performers-2-350x233.jpg 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Starbucks-top-performers-2-300x200-1.jpg 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Starbucks-top-performers-2-768x512-1.jpg 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Starbucks-top-performers-2-1024x683-1.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1146px) 100vw, 1146px" /></a></p>
<p>Top performers help move their organizations forward swiftly and successfully, attracting new clients, developing other talented employees, and mitigating risk by going above and beyond for guests.</p>
<p>All of this is only possible if leaders know who they are, foster their skills, passions, and productivity, and reward them for their remarkable efforts.</p>
<p>Find them. Recognize them. Then watch them — and the organization — thrive.</p>

				<p>Many public company restaurant CEOs have been called on recently to answer for their sluggish responses to the emerging challenges that characterize the modern foodservice era. Oftentimes, their responsibly worded reply is an acknowledgment that the world was changing outside their business faster than it was improving inside their business.</p><p>Rising food and labor costs, the challenges and capital intensity of retooling and modernizing a company, geopolitical threats for multinationals, activist investors, shrinking share and margins, and so much more — it’s a wonder how a chain restaurant CEO or leadership team can get any restful sleep at all.  On top of that, of course, there’s the realization that any hour a corporate communications nightmare could break out, threatening to undo a brand (and careers) that took decades to build as each new sensationalized headline hacks at hard-won reputations and shareholder value.</p><p>But, you already know being on top and building something remarkable has never been easy. So, you continue with what’s worked — putting in the hours, the homework and the hard work, surrounding yourself with brilliant people, and asking the tough questions of both yourself and your team.</p><p>In that spirit, here are a few new questions restaurant CEOs will need to ask and answer more frequently than in years past:</p><ol><li>Are we really prepared for a sizable and sustained <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-corporate-communications">crisis communications</a> challenge? Starbucks, Chipotle, McDonald’s, Papa John’s — they’ve all been in the headlines lately. Some responded better than others to the situations that hurled them unexpectedly into primetime news. But, every billion-dollar brand has faced — or will face — its own acute crisis. Just as software companies must continually iterate and patch new security vulnerabilities faster than the threats evolve, so too must CEOs support investments in their corporate communications departments and reputation management function. Ultimately, the CEO will have to run with this playbook on a fast relay — much like a president and secret service must train so they know what to do in an emergency as quickly as they discern if that sound was a bullet cracking or a balloon popping.</li><li>Have we engineered as much <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-technology-trends">convenience</a> as possible into the guest experience and our own internal operations as we can and should? What areas of friction keep guests from getting our food, and how can we smooth those out?</li><li>Are we relying on the same tired and routine <a href="https://aaronallen.com/restaurant-planning">annual planning</a> approaches we’ve always used, or are we taking a fresh approach that will help stir passions and performance?</li><li>What’s on the horizon in terms of PESTLE (political, economic, societal, technological, legal, and environmental) <a href="https://aaronallen.com/restaurant-research">implications</a>? How might they impact CAPEX and OPEX over a rolling 36-month period? Do our financial and operational models need to be updated?</li><li>Is our <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-marketing-audit">marketing</a> function properly modernized and fit-for-purpose to outperform our traditional competitive set and new challengers? Are we doing the right things with earned media, mobile and omnichannel strategy, pricing psychology and promotional strategy, PPC, SEO/SEM, e/m/s-commerce, geolocation technologies, CRM, LSM, loyalty initiatives, and UX/UI optimization across all devices, including self-ordering systems? This may seem like a gratuitous use of acronyms and marketing mumbo-jumbo that the head of marketing should be handling, and to some extent it is and she is, however, there are also a lot of organizational interdependencies to get these initiatives implemented to their full potential. And to the extent of top-level support — and just how quickly competitive advantage is had in these areas — that warrants a review. Is the functional area leader and the team getting the support of resources and buy-in needed to modernize marketing? In many instances, more is needed from the CEO to get marketing, technology, operations, finance, and strategy function leaders to ensure the potential of MarTech is not hampered by politics and internal turf wars.</li><li>What should we be doing about emerging <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-innovation">disruptive</a> forces in delivery, drive-thru, self-ordering, and mobile optimization? Which fit best with our brand promise and positioning, and which will do more damage to our unique value proposition than boost sales?</li><li>Is our organizational design optimized for how the business has and continues to evolve?</li><li>Do we have the right brands and locations, or should we give our portfolio a trim? What brands and units should we <a href="https://aaronallen.com/restaurant-private-equity">create, acquire, grow, or divest</a>?</li><li>Should we reconsider our prototype design and location strategy in light of the new unit economic models being rewarded with capital and customers? As people move back to cities, reversing decades of suburbanization, new formats — such as food halls, dark kitchens, delivery-only concepts, meal kits, home meal replacement, and curbside pick-up — are revolutionizing the industry. What does the <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-robots-replace-workers">restaurant of the future</a> look like for us?</li><li>Do we have the right tools and <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-technologies">technology</a>? What should we source from third parties, and what should we create in-house? What emerging concepts and competitors should we have on our radar? What are the true costs and benefits (from a holistic impact-analysis study that factors in the wider implications on time and materials, SG&amp;A, trade-offs, competitive proposition, and so on)?</li></ol><p>Though many of the challenges restaurants CEOs face today relate to the incredible pace of change that’s making us faster and more connected at an exponential rate, they all come back to the question that sits at the heart of the hospitality business: Are we doing everything we can to make our guests feel welcome, cared for, and heard? Looking at digital marketing, social media, and mobile, digital, and self-ordering technologies through the lens of care, compassion, and empathy is the first step toward ensuring that you’re finding the right answers for your business.</p><p>And, in case you’ve got these concerns all sorted out, we have more questions for the scrolling marquee hanging overhead. </p><h2>More Insights for the Conscientious CEO: </h2><ul><li><a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-ceo">25 Scary Things Keeping Restaurant CEOs Awake at Night</a></li><li><a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/how-to-reduce-restaurant-food-cost">25 Questions That Can Lower Your Food Costs</a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/greatest-show-earth-folds-its-tent-heres-restaurant-industry-allen/">This Failure Can Teach You About Innovation</a></li><li><a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-brand-audit">Are We Relevant?: Questions for the CEO</a></li></ul>					</div>

				<p>Any pizzeria owner or chain executives who keeps up with the business news is likely more than a little green with envy (by now, probably emerald). The reason: Domino’s is killing it online.</p><p>While over 75% of the US restaurant industry is still struggling to get its act together and launch an app that actually works, Domino’s has leapfrogged the competition, flaunting collaborations with some of the most game-changing tech innovations (<a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/dominos-pizza-delivery-technology">Domino’s</a> now supports orders from the Amazon Echo and Apple Watch). These new initiatives make its emoji-enabled ordering by tweet or by text look like a gimmick.</p><p>The pizza chain’s been-there-done-that-what’s-next attitude toward tech means that 60% of its revenue (something to the tune of $2 billion system-wide sales in the US) comes through digital channels. Average franchisee same-store sales growth averaging over 10% from 2015 to 2018. CEO Patrick Doyle has also claimed that, in terms of transaction counts, Domino’s is competing with the likes of Amazon and Apple, ranking among the world’s top five online retailers.</p><p>Domino’s ahead-of-the-game adaptations of digital convenience engineering have gotten to the point where the company will soon make ordering from its website obsolete. But the company is not blowing its competition out of the water simply because it was an early adaptor of digital integration. There’s plenty more to it.</p><h2>ONE OF THE BIGGEST ONLINE RETAILERS? THAT SOUNDS FAMILIAR.</h2><p>In January 2008, Domino’s launched its Pizza Tracker web system — an online application that allowed guests to keep tabs on the progress of their order with a 40-second accuracy margin.</p><p>Prior to launching Pizza Tracker, Domino’s saw less than 15% of its sales from online orders; with the new system, the website started generating 20% of company sales — a “win” from any perspective.</p><p>Domino’s bet big; it launched one of the best digital ordering systems the industry had ever seen. Pizza Tracker boosted online ordering profits by 23% because online guests spent, on average, $2 more than those who ordered over the phone or in person.</p><p>It also made the pizza chain the fourth-largest e-retailer in 2010 (to be fair, the competition back then consisted of Amazon, Staples, and Office Depot).</p><p>And yet, in 2008, Domino’s stock was still selling for less than $3 per share, and company same-store sales in the U.S. fell 4.9% system-wide, with franchise stores seeing an even worse 5.2% decrease. These figures were seven times worse than the industry average. While in 2008 and 2009 the US pizza industry saw 1.3% and 2.5% unit growth, respectively, between 2008 and 2009 Domino’s closed 120 domestic units.</p><p>Convenience engineering can only go so far. If product quality and other elements of the guest experience are compromised, no one will order — no matter how easy it is. A question posed in a January 2008 Gizmodo article about Pizza Tracker summed this up well.</p><p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10860" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dominos-Turnaround-Pizzas.jpg" alt="Domino's Turnaround Pizzas" width="974" height="650" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dominos-Turnaround-Pizzas.jpg 974w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dominos-Turnaround-Pizzas-350x234.jpg 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dominos-Turnaround-Pizzas-300x200-1.jpg 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dominos-Turnaround-Pizzas-768x513-1.jpg 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dominos-Turnaround-Pizzas-970x647-1.jpg 970w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dominos-Turnaround-Pizzas-500x334-1.jpg 500w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dominos-Turnaround-Pizzas-640x427-1.jpg 640w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dominos-Turnaround-Pizzas-186x124-1.jpg 186w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dominos-Turnaround-Pizzas-135x90-1.jpg 135w" sizes="(max-width: 974px) 100vw, 974px" /></p><p>The answer, according to the sales figures, was no.</p><h2>GOOD MARKETING KILLS DYING BRANDS FASTER</h2><p>The story of the Domino’s Pizza Tracker illustrates a hard truth: great marketing will only kill a bad operation faster. And, at the time, Domino’s wasn’t just wounded, it was hemorrhaging.</p><p>A few screenshots of customer comments (pulled from the first ten seconds of the company’s comeback ad) paint a pretty vivid picture of just how bad the problems were: </p><p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10861" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dominos-Turnaround-Twitter.jpg" alt="Domino's Turnaround Twitter" width="1230" height="1083" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dominos-Turnaround-Twitter.jpg 1230w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dominos-Turnaround-Twitter-350x308.jpg 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dominos-Turnaround-Twitter-300x264-1.jpg 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dominos-Turnaround-Twitter-768x676-1.jpg 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dominos-Turnaround-Twitter-1024x902-1.jpg 1024w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dominos-Turnaround-Twitter-970x854-1.jpg 970w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dominos-Turnaround-Twitter-500x440-1.jpg 500w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dominos-Turnaround-Twitter-640x564-1.jpg 640w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dominos-Turnaround-Twitter-141x124-1.jpg 141w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dominos-Turnaround-Twitter-102x90-1.jpg 102w" sizes="(max-width: 1230px) 100vw, 1230px" /></p><p>By April 2009, Domino’s poor product perceptions had positioned the brand as a house of cards, ready to topple if someone as much as sneezed. Unfortunately, lots of employees did, all over customers’ orders.</p><p>When videos of Domino’s employees doing unspeakable things to the product went viral, the company tried to handle the situation, posting their own YouTube video, in which CEO Patrick Doyle called the whole thing a “hoax.”</p><p>But the painful reality was that viewers had lost all confidence in the brand. Domino’s <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-crisis-communications">crisis communications</a> was too little, too late. The video showing the health-code violation had nearly eight times the views as the company’s response.</p><p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10862" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dominos-Turnaround-Viral-Video.png" alt="Domino's Turnaround Viral Video" width="974" height="645" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dominos-Turnaround-Viral-Video.png 974w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dominos-Turnaround-Viral-Video-350x232.png 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dominos-Turnaround-Viral-Video-300x199.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dominos-Turnaround-Viral-Video-768x509.png 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dominos-Turnaround-Viral-Video-970x642.png 970w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dominos-Turnaround-Viral-Video-500x331.png 500w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dominos-Turnaround-Viral-Video-640x424.png 640w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dominos-Turnaround-Viral-Video-187x124.png 187w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dominos-Turnaround-Viral-Video-136x90.png 136w" sizes="(max-width: 974px) 100vw, 974px" /></p><p>In just about 24 hours, Domino’s public perception plummeted. According to BrandIndex, the company’s “buzz ranking” (a score that ranges from 100 to -100, tracking positive and negative sentiment) dropped from 22.5 to 13.6 in less than a week. Even though the company’s PR team knew about the video with 45 minutes of it being posted, same-store sales plummeted, falling from roughly 1.0% in Q1-2009 to -0.7% in Q2 and flat (0%) in Q3.</p><h2>TIME FOR A TURNAROUND</h2><p>Everything had gone wrong for Domino’s: an unpopular product, a food-safety scandal, and a mishandled crisis response team. Fortunately, it got its turnaround campaign exactly right.</p><p>The company didn’t make excuses. It didn’t discount. It didn’t compare itself to competitors. It didn’t promise to be faster. It recognized that it was leading the way in delivery for all the wrong reasons, living up to its promise of pizza at your door in under 30 minutes by sacrificing quality (frozen, canned ingredients that left the crust tasting like cardboard) and sometimes even its drivers’ safety.</p><p>In December 2009, Domino’s apologized. And it got to work.</p><p>Everyone remembers the 2010 ad campaign nicknamed “Our Pizza Sucks.” Rather than ignoring the negative commentary, Domino’s fully embraced it (even displaying instant reviews on a marquee in Times Square — imagine having your criticisms advertised to hundreds of thousands each day).</p><p><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AH5R56jILag" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p><p>In Q1 2010, the company saw a 14.3% increase in revenue over the previous quarter. From December 2009 to December 2010, Domino’s stock shot up 130%. By 2010, domestic same-store sales were up 10.3%, a near-10 percentage point increase over 2009.</p><p>Domino’s stock has since reached 89x higher than pre-turnaround levels (with a low of $2.83 per share and topping out at $252+ per share in May 2018) thanks to an epic campaign that generated over one billion free PR impressions — <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/earned-media-restaurant-high-valuation">earned media</a> that pays big dividends.</p><div class="infogram-embed" data-id="b318fc9c-bdf3-4fbd-bc5a-269b7eb497e1" data-type="interactive" data-title="Domino's Stock"> </div><p><script>!function(e,t,n,s){var i="InfogramEmbeds",o=e.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?"http:":"https:";if(/^\/{2}/.test(s)&&(s=d+s),window[i]&&window[i].initialized)window[i].process&&window[i].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var a=e.createElement(t);a.async=1,a.id=n,a.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(a,o)}}(document,"script","infogram-async","https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js");</script></p><p>Thanks to continued investment in technology and a commitment to executing on its core competencies, Domino’s has continued to see same-store sales increase consistently. It’s officially overtaken Pizza Hut as the world’s largest pizza chain (the leading delivery player, and in second place for carryout orders).</p><p>What’s more, Domino’s invested in its people. Following the turnaround, Doyle reported that 90% of the brand’s hourly workers turn a position at Domino’s into a full-time career path. On top of the fact that <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/associate-engagement-cost-of-pissed-off-employees-quantified">engaged associates</a> are more profitable team members, a statistic like this also goes miles in ensuring there will be no more booger-lover pizzas served.</p><h2>GOING FOR GOLD</h2><p>Even when Domino’s was in the thick of its perception crisis, it still ranked as the second pizza chain in the US (seeing $3 billion in system-wide revenue in 2009 compared to Pizza Hut’s $5 billion).</p><p>Since its 2010 turnaround, Domino’s has brought its tech team in-house (as of 2018, more than half of Domino’s team members at the world headquarters are technologists or others with an analytical focus, according to Jeffrey D. Lawrence, the company’s CFO and EVP), taking full responsibility for the development of its app and website. This investment has been paying off.</p><p>Over 60% of Domino’s orders now come from digital channels. Back in 2011 when the company launched its iPhone app, it took 28 days to see $1 million in sales. Three months after the release, the Domino’s app was seeing $1 million in sales each week.</p><p>From 2015 to 2016, system-wide sales for Domino’s grew 10%, overall. Nearly all of this growth was attributable to digital sales (web, mobile, and other less traditional channels such as the Echo or Twitter orders), with a 19% increase. Non-digital sales (phone-in orders or ordering at the store directly) only contributed a 1% growth.</p><p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10863" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dominos-Digital-Growth.png" alt="Domino's Digital Growth" width="974" height="645" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dominos-Digital-Growth.png 974w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dominos-Digital-Growth-350x232.png 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dominos-Digital-Growth-300x199.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dominos-Digital-Growth-768x509.png 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dominos-Digital-Growth-970x642.png 970w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dominos-Digital-Growth-500x331.png 500w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dominos-Digital-Growth-640x424.png 640w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dominos-Digital-Growth-187x124.png 187w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Dominos-Digital-Growth-136x90.png 136w" sizes="(max-width: 974px) 100vw, 974px" /></p><p>Domino’s proves that you can never make it too easy for customers to buy from you. It has also shown that R&amp;D can pay off handsomely. It’s an inspiring story, and other chain operations should take it to heart.</p><p>But rather than try to copy Domino’s success by developing their own iPhone, Alexa, and Echo apps, they should consider how digital channels can be leveraged to extend their specific brand promise. Domino’s convenience-focused tech suits a brand known for fast delivery, but it wouldn’t make sense for a fine-dining establishment that built its reputation on superior service and ambiance.   </p><p>Any restaurant looking to make a turnaround should consider how technology can fit into its operations — as long as it doesn’t forget the qualities that keep its customers coming back again and again.  </p><h3>ABOUT AARON ALLEN &amp; ASSOCIATES</h3><p><a href="https://aaronallen.com/">Aaron Allen &amp; Associates</a> is a leading global restaurant industry consultancy specializing in growth strategy, marketing, branding, and commercial due diligence for emerging and established restaurant chains and prestigious <a href="https://aaronallen.com/restaurant-private-equity">private equity</a> firms.

Would you expand into new markets, roll out the prototypes you&#8217;ve been dreaming of, or deploy new technology to make it even easier for diners to get your food? We&#8217;re predicting a lot of activity in the <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/lower-middle-market-return-on-investment">lower middle-market segment</a>, where strong valuations and solid growth are attracting a lot of interest. Already this year, firms representing $3–$4b in buy-side capital have approached us, looking for the next big thing in foodservice.</p>
<p>The world of private equity investments is complex. Here we offer a brief overview of PE funds operations, focusing specifically on each stage of the deal, while a second post has a six-step guide for getting a restaurant operation transaction ready.</p>

<p>A typical private equity firm has a group of general partners, or fund managers, who raise capital, find investment opportunities, and oversee the organization’s portfolio. These funds don’t select businesses that seem like they will grow on their own; instead, they take an active hand in building value over the life of the investment. Most general partners have deep expertise in managerial strategies and want to help their investments streamline operations, optimize efficiency and performance, and grow in a sustainable way.</p>
<p>This means private equity firms are by and large strategic, as opposed to financial, investors. Financial buyers have a more hands-off approach: they want to put money in, let the existing operation grow it, and take it out a few years later. In contrast, strategic buyers recognize their target investments as collaborators in value growth.</p>
<p>Some firms specialize in specific industries, while others are striving to offer a well-rounded portfolio to the institutional and individual investors who put capital into the fund. In either case, private equity firms expect to take an active role in managing the businesses in their portfolios.</p>
<p>The investment funds come from the firm itself and from limited partners — often pension funds, insurance companies, or other nations’ sovereign wealth funds, though HNWIs sometimes contribute as well.</p>
<p>Firms invest in and acquire companies that seem likely to increase in value over the course of the investment. This may mean the business is underperforming or undervalued, or it may mean that the general partners recognize that the restaurant has something special: a new concept just waiting to go national (or international), hold on a hard-to-claim market share, or an operational system that could revolutionize the industry.</p>
<p>Regardless of a firm’s area of specialty or reason for investing, most follow a similar life cycle:</p>
<h2>Fundraising Period</h2>
<p>General partners solicit funds for a particular project from limited partners. The firm may define these projects narrowly (“acquire in Bob’s Fine Dining on Spruce Street”) or broadly (“invest in a restaurant chain in North Africa”)</p>
<h2>Hold Period</h2>
<p>After signing investment and acquisition deals, fund managers work with the restaurant’s executive team to grow revenue and improve margins. Cash flows tend to break even in years three to five.</p>
<p>The length of the hold period will vary. Some firms, like Berkshire Hathaway, prefer longer hold periods, which allow management and efficiency improvements to mature. Others go for quick flips, with investments sometimes lasting as little as 12 weeks (in the case of Blackstone’s 2016 sale of Strategic Hotels &amp; Resorts).</p>
<p>Today, the average hold period is just over five years, up from the much shorter 3.3 year (median) between 2006 and 2008.</p>
<h2>Harvest Period</h2>
<p>Funds sell their stake in the company or make an initial public offering (IPO). General partners claim 20% of the profit and distribute the rest to their limited partners.</p>
<p>Fund managers walk a tightrope. On the one hand, they have capital that must be put to work. On the other hand, they have a group of investors expecting a certain rate of return, so they must avoid risky deals that won’t deliver.</p>
<p>To find the sweet spot between profit and risk, funds undertake intensive pre-deal research into their targets’ financial, legal, commercial, and operational status and prospects. Each step of the deal timeline involves increasing scrutiny and discussion, all building to a final bid that satisfies both parties and sets them up for post-deal success.</p>

<p>After a PE firm raises money, it must decide where to put it. Fund managers go through seven stages of research, due diligence, and negotiation to find a partnership or sale that fits in with their strategic goals.</p>
<h2>Sourcing</h2>
<p>Firms locate target investments and acquisitions in a number of ways. Using their own research or intermediaries, they’ll learn about opportunities that other firms may not be aware of. (Many fund managers approach our consultancy for just this insider knowledge, so that we play matchmakers in their next deal.)</p>
<p>Restaurants may also circulate teasers to alert private equity firms to new opportunities in a process known as a public auction. Before contacting the target, the firm will conduct preliminary studies to assess the opportunity. If it seems like a good investment, the fund manager and restaurant will sign an NDA, and the restaurant will share its <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-confidential-information-memorandum">Confidential Information Memorandum</a>.</p>
<h2>Letter of Intent (LOI)</h2>
<p>The firm may present sellers with an LOI, which outlines the deal in broad terms and may contain an exclusivity clause. The sell-side team should share this document — especially language around an exclusivity period, purchase price, and deal conditions — with legal counsel, as it may contain unfavorable terms.</p>
<h2><a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-due-diligence">Due Diligence</a></h2>
<p>The PE firm will conduct research on the industry, hold discussions with expert consultants, and build preliminary financial projections. The restaurant will provide confidential to help fund managers embark on a thorough round of financial, legal, commercial, and operational due diligence. (See our <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/due-diligence-checklist">due diligence checklist</a> to understand which documents investors are likely to request.)</p>
<h2>First-Round Bid</h2>
<p>If due diligence doesn’t surface any red flags and the investment appears to be a good strategic fit, the firm will submit a first-round bid. In public auctions, where more than one firm is involved, the sell-side team will select which firms move on to the next round.</p>
<h2>Modeling &amp; Strategic Alignment</h2>
<p>Following a more detailed investment model, the firm will lay out its comprehensive investment thesis, explaining why it&#8217;s looking to invest in this particular operation, and its strategic plan. A Preliminary Investment Memorandum will summarize the opportunity for the benefit of the firm&#8217;s Investment Committee.</p>
<h2>Binding Bid</h2>
<p>A Final Investment Memorandum (FIM) will be drafted, informed by further <a href="https://aaronallen.com/restaurant-private-equity">buy-side due diligence</a> (often conducted by third-party consultants). The FIM includes purchase price and preliminary merger agreements, which describe changes to the target&#8217;s management team, employment structure, stock options, and so on.</p>
<h2>Closing</h2>
<p>Though it&#8217;s called a binding bid, there&#8217;s still room for negotiations. The potential investor and target company will meet to discuss every detail of the offer. The PE firm will come with lawyers experienced in investment transactions — and so should restaurant operators.</p>
<p>To prepare for this process, restaurants should start about 18 months before the desired closing date. In that time, they should undertake the same in-depth study of their organization as investors will throughout the pre-deal process. With this information, the operation can accurately estimate its value, identify red and yellow flags that could negatively affect the transaction, and speak more confidently about the deal to potential investors.</p>
