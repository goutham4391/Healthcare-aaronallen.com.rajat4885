										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Americans celebrate the Fourth of July with backyard BBQs and massive fireworks displays. In Indonesia, communities compete in a number of friendly matches, from rope pulls and gunny sack races to the pinang pole climb, when men race to the top of greased-up palm trees in hopes of claiming prizes. India celebrates by flying kites, Peru with bullfights, and Mexico by reading the <em>Grito de Dolores</em>.</p>
<p>With such a wide variety of ways of celebrating, it’s no surprise that we found so many examples of compelling hotel and restaurants experiences that honor their countries’ histories and traditions — as well as drive traffic and sales.</p>
<h2>1. Give Back</h2>
<p>Outback Steakhouse is offering guests the opportunity to add a $1 donation to their bills to support Operation Homefront, a nonprofit that helps military families in need. In 2017, the Bombay Canteen in Mumbai donated all its proceeds from a special menu to the Miracle Foundation, which support orphaned children. These promotions are great ways to highlight an organization’s strong ties to the community and can create excellent earned media.</p>
<h2>2. Make the Most of Your Location</h2>
<p>Mexico City’s Gran Hotel is located on Plaza de la Constitución, better known as Zócalo, the large downtown square that’s ground zero for the start of the nation’s independence celebration at 11PM on September 15. The hotel’s gourmet, fifth-floor restaurant overlooks the square, where 500,000 people gather each year to kick off the festivities.</p>

<h2>3. Honor Your Neighborhood</h2>
<p>There’s no reason to limit yourself to celebrating only one national holiday a year. For example, Chicago hosts parades and street festivals for a number of global celebrations, including Mexican Independence Day (September 16), Polish Constitution Day (May 3), and Ukrainian Independence Day (August 26). Food vendors set up around the parade route, giving smaller shops a chance to get their authentic recipes into hungry revelers’ hands.</p>
<h2>4. Play with Your Food</h2>
<p>Tom Colicchio’s Riverpark, a New American restaurant right on the East River in Manhattan, is celebrating July 4 with an all-you-can eat BBQ buffet. While not eating, guests are invited to play lawn games, like bocce ball and cornhole. As an added bonus, the location is the perfect place to view Macy’s fireworks.</p>
<h2>5. Wear Your Colors</h2>
<p>L’Opéra, a high-end bakery chain in India, creates its signature tricolor cake, flavored with litchi, blood orange, and coconut, to match its nation’s flag and to honor its Independence Day (August 15).</p>

<h2>6. Drink Up the Patriotism</h2>
<p>RA Sushi Bar, which has locations in nine U.S. states, mixes up the bombpop: a red, white, and blue shot with vodka, Blue Curacao, and grenadine.</p>
<h2>7. Stuff Your Patrons</h2>
<p>Nathan’s Hot Dog Eating Contest at New York’s Coney Island has been an annual event since the 1970s, though the original promoter claimed the contest dated back to 1916, when four immigrants challenged each other to prove their patriotism by eating as many hot dogs as they could. No matter when it started, the contest does a great job of reminding people about the iconic brand.</p>

<h2>10. Celebrate Your History</h2>

Of course, these events work best when they align with the organizations’ guiding brand values, so operators should find their own way of marking these important celebrations — one that reflects everything that sets them apart from the competition.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most business leaders recognize the importance of restaurant corporate communications, but very few companies actively invest in developing robust communication channels or in building a sustainable corporate culture.</p>
<p>Done with intention and authenticity, communications becomes a strategic lever pulled to share a business’s values with the public. It’s as essential to a restaurant’s operation as its menu offerings and food suppliers. These practices have quantifiable impacts across a number of metrics, including recruiting, retention, reduced turnover, increased engagement, growth, expansion, same-store sales, net promoter scores, and more.</p>
<p>Building and executing an effective restaurant corporate communications plan requires commitment from the top and sustained, deliberate action and investment, but these up-front costs are paid back with interest.</p>
<h2>1. Employees Aren’t Bricklayers; They’re Building a Cathedral</h2>
<p>The old adage “loose lips sink ships” might encourage some leaders to share information only on a need-to-know basis. But, as long as we’re trading in military metaphors, it’s worth pointing out that the first thing generals try to do is knock out their enemy’s communications.</p>
<p>Though no one’s going to war over same-store sales or franchise rights, these examples signal how important a strong communications plan is to most large operations.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10787" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Corporate-Communications-Associate-Engagement.jpg" alt="Corporate Communications Associate Engagement" width="974" height="697" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Corporate-Communications-Associate-Engagement.jpg 974w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Corporate-Communications-Associate-Engagement-350x250.jpg 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Corporate-Communications-Associate-Engagement-300x215.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Corporate-Communications-Associate-Engagement-768x550-1.jpg 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Corporate-Communications-Associate-Engagement-970x694-1.jpg 970w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Corporate-Communications-Associate-Engagement-500x358-1.jpg 500w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Corporate-Communications-Associate-Engagement-173x124-1.jpg 173w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Corporate-Communications-Associate-Engagement-126x90-1.jpg 126w" sizes="(max-width: 974px) 100vw, 974px" /></p>
<p>Employees aren’t mushrooms: you can’t leave them in the dark and feed them compost. They’ll know if they’re only hearing half the story — and they’ll invent the other half if it’s not provided. This is particularly powerful for today’s workforce, largely impacted by millennials who identify with a sense of purpose and value trust and transparency.</p>
<p>Finding the correct balance between discretion and honesty will impart confidence in the executive team to employees as well as customers, reporters, investors, landlords, community members, and other stakeholders. This kind of communication also shows employees how their role in the company feeds into the organization’s larger strategies. And, indeed, people are five times more committed when they feel they’re a part of an initiative.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10786" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Communications-Plan-Empoyee-Engagement-Productivity.jpg" alt="Communications Plan Employee Engagement Productivity" width="974" height="277" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Communications-Plan-Empoyee-Engagement-Productivity.jpg 974w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Communications-Plan-Empoyee-Engagement-Productivity-350x100.jpg 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Communications-Plan-Empoyee-Engagement-Productivity-300x85.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Communications-Plan-Empoyee-Engagement-Productivity-768x218-1.jpg 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Communications-Plan-Empoyee-Engagement-Productivity-970x276-1.jpg 970w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Communications-Plan-Empoyee-Engagement-Productivity-500x142-1.jpg 500w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Communications-Plan-Empoyee-Engagement-Productivity-220x63-1.jpg 220w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Communications-Plan-Empoyee-Engagement-Productivity-160x46-1.jpg 160w" sizes="(max-width: 974px) 100vw, 974px" /></p>
<p>Commitment leads to associate engagement, which the vast majority (90%) of business owners see as vital to their companies’ futures. They’re right to put so much emphasis on employee commitment: companies with actively engaged employees earn 2.5x more than companies with disengaged employees. This engagement drives productivity, which improves by 20–25% in organizations with connected employees.</p>
<p>And yet, only 25% of US businesses have implemented an associate engagement program.</p>
<h2>2. It Pays to be Optimistic</h2>
<p>When CEOs communicate via social channels, it tends to impart a higher level of trust. Tweets and status updates appear more genuine than press releases that suffered under a dozen lawyers’ red pens.</p>
<p>For example, last February, a snowball fight broke out in front of the Shake Shack in Madison Square Park. After the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/businessinsider/videos/vb.20446254070/10154368635599071/?type=2&amp;theater">video went viral</a>, the burger chain revealed that the combatants were all Shake Shack team members.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10790" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Earned-Media-Corporate-Communications-Plan.png" alt="Earned Media Corporate Communications" width="462" height="504" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Earned-Media-Corporate-Communications-Plan.png 462w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Earned-Media-Corporate-Communications-Plan-350x382.png 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Earned-Media-Corporate-Communications-Plan-275x300.png 275w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Earned-Media-Corporate-Communications-Plan-300x327.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Earned-Media-Corporate-Communications-Plan-114x124.png 114w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Earned-Media-Corporate-Communications-Plan-83x90.png 83w" sizes="(max-width: 462px) 100vw, 462px" /></p>
<p>Having the COO take the time to come out and have fun with his employees communicates the brand’s personality — not only to the company’s partners around the world but to consumers and other future partners, be they potential franchisees, journalists and reporters, landlords, or crew-level employees choosing where to apply.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that a staggering 92% of consumers say they trust <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/earned-media-restaurant-high-valuation">earned media</a> while only half trust paid ads. Consumers find earned media appealing because it feels natural and authentic, as opposed to traditional TV spots, even the best of which are clearly the product of writers, producers, and publicists.</p>
<p>Crafting a restaurant corporate communications plan that is agile enough to capitalize on these impromptu moments doesn’t just win Facebook Likes: earned media can drive 4x the brand lift of paid media.</p>
<h2>3. Honesty is Still the Best Policy</h2>
<p>The most retweeted tweet of all time was the result of consumer-brand engagement: <a href="http://fortune.com/2017/05/09/nugget-boy-retweet-record-twitter-wendys/">Carter Wilkerson</a> asked Wendy’s for a year of free chicken nuggets, and Twitter users went wild supporting the outlandish request. In the end, Wilkerson got his #freenuggs, and Wendy’s got a ton of positive publicity.</p>
<p>Despite this famous example, seven out of eight social-media messages to brands remain unanswered after 72 hours. These companies are ignoring an integral aspect of customer service, a particularly bad choice when 86% of consumers report that their buying decisions are influenced by online reviews.</p>
<p>Starting in 2014, McDonald’s Canada launched “Our Food. Your Questions,” a website where consumers could ask the burger chain anything they wanted. Customers queried everything from what type of cow McDonald’s beef comes from, to when the McRib, McPizza, and Szechuan sauce are coming back.</p>

<p>Considering the amount of disinformation available about McDonald’s, its food — remember the pink slime? — and its corporate practices, this is a radical step in the right direction.</p>
<h2>4. A Steal at Twice the Price</h2>
<p>What would you do if something went <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/schultz-johnson-show-profits-follow-purpose-aaron-d-allen/">terribly wrong </a>at one of your locations? Maybe a foodborne illness breaks out, or maybe a crew-level employee makes a judgment call that goes against your company’s deepest-held values. How would you respond? A tweet? A press release? An appearance on some morning talk shows?</p>
<p>A survey of business decision-makers who don’t have a crisis communication plan produced some interesting findings. One-third said they haven’t invested in one because it would “rarely… be needed,” despite the fact that 59% of this sample had experienced a crisis at either their current or previous organizations. Another 19% said “it’s too difficult to set up or manage,” and 15% said it was “too expensive.”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10789" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Corporate-Crisis-Communications-Plan.jpg" alt="" width="974" height="291" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Corporate-Crisis-Communications-Plan.jpg 974w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Corporate-Crisis-Communications-Plan-350x105.jpg 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Corporate-Crisis-Communications-Plan-300x90.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Corporate-Crisis-Communications-Plan-768x229-1.jpg 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Corporate-Crisis-Communications-Plan-970x290-1.jpg 970w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Corporate-Crisis-Communications-Plan-500x149-1.jpg 500w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Corporate-Crisis-Communications-Plan-220x66.png 220w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Corporate-Crisis-Communications-Plan-160x48.png 160w" sizes="(max-width: 974px) 100vw, 974px" /></p>
<p>The average cost of a crisis is $5.8 million in reputation and brand damage, $4 million in lost productivity, $3.7 million in lost revenue, and $1.6 million in compliance costs. So, what’s more expensive — developing a crisis communications plan or moving forward without one?</p>
<p>Any complex system — be it an organism or an organization — needs an effective communications system to survive. Just as the human body doesn’t wait to build a stomach until it needs to digest food, corporations shouldn’t wait to develop a system for responding to crises until their whole enterprise is at risk.</p>
<p>The benefit of investing in an integrated restaurant corporate communications plan is not simply protecting the brand and its revenue streams. It also builds strong relationships among employees and between the company, its consumers, and its community. Sustainable enterprises are good communicators. They share information between all aspects of their organization and with outside stakeholders as well.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Labor Day is meant to be a celebration of American workers – a day they can take off from work to enjoy some time outside. And with the US unemployment rate recently dropping to 4.3%, there are a whole lot of people likely to be celebrating. More free time for consumers means an ideal opportunity for restaurant chains eager to fill their tables, and increase their sales, during the holiday.</p>
<p>Roughly 35 million people will travel this Labor Day weekend to vacation with family or take a small break. While this is a boon to airlines and other transportation companies, it&#8217;s also an opportunity for retailers (who are well-known to compete for Labor Day sales dollars) and restaurants. Below, a look at how various chains have utilized Labor Day restaurant marketing tactics to their advantage.</p>
<h2>1. Olive Garden Treats First Responders</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10225" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/restaurant-labor-day-marketing-Olive-Garden.png" alt="restaurant labor day marketing Olive Garden" width="1426" height="434" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/restaurant-labor-day-marketing-Olive-Garden.png 1426w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/restaurant-labor-day-marketing-Olive-Garden-350x107.png 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/restaurant-labor-day-marketing-Olive-Garden-300x91.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/restaurant-labor-day-marketing-Olive-Garden-768x234.png 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/restaurant-labor-day-marketing-Olive-Garden-1024x312.png 1024w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/restaurant-labor-day-marketing-Olive-Garden-970x295.png 970w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/restaurant-labor-day-marketing-Olive-Garden-500x152.png 500w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/restaurant-labor-day-marketing-Olive-Garden-220x67.png 220w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/restaurant-labor-day-marketing-Olive-Garden-160x49.png 160w" sizes="(max-width: 1426px) 100vw, 1426px" /></p>
<p>For 16 years now, Olive Garden locations throughout the country have used Labor Day as an excuse to treat local First Responders to lunch. While the pasta chain hasn&#8217;t devoted a lot of marketing to the project, it&#8217;s certainly generated earned media.</p>
<h2>2. LongHorn Fires Up Its Grill Hotline</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10231" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/LongHorn-Steakhouse-labor-day-restaurant-marketing-e1504197081216.png" alt="LongHorn Steakhouse labor day restaurant marketing" width="500" height="242" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/LongHorn-Steakhouse-labor-day-restaurant-marketing-e1504197081216.png 500w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/LongHorn-Steakhouse-labor-day-restaurant-marketing-e1504197081216-350x169.png 350w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p>While most restaurants would prefer that guests come in to eat, many realize how popular Labor Day is for grilling at home. Which is why LongHorn Steakhouse offers its own experts to help diners do just that. The LongHorn Steakhouse Grill Us Hotline returns each Labor Day weekend to provide tips from the restaurant’s certified Grill Masters, who prepare every grilled item on the LongHorn Steakhouse menu. Grillers can either call or live text the Grill Masters during Hotline hours to receive answers to all of their grilling questions. In addition, the chain offers a website full of chef videos, recipes, tips and tricks (along with, of course, links to the restaurant&#8217;s own menu and convenient ways to order online).</p>
<h2>3. Burger King Unveils Its Grilled Hot Dog</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10229" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Burger-King-hot-dog-labor-day-restaurant-marketing-e1504196209604.png" alt="Burger King hot dog labor day restaurant marketing" width="500" height="701" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Burger-King-hot-dog-labor-day-restaurant-marketing-e1504196209604.png 500w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Burger-King-hot-dog-labor-day-restaurant-marketing-e1504196209604-350x491.png 350w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p>While it wasn&#8217;t specifically tied to Labor Day, Burger King used the long weekend in 2016 to launch its grilled hot dog, marking them at just $1 on Saturday and Sunday. No coupon was required, but there was a limit of 5 per person and the deal was only valid for the Classic Grilled Dog. The move paid off, with Restaurant Brands International (the parent company) reporting sales rose 4.6% globally, due in part to the addition and launch of &#8220;premium&#8221; menu items, like the grilled hot dog.</p>
<h2>4. Firehouse Subs Touts Buy-One-Get-One</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10226" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Firehouse-Subs-labor-day-marketing-e1504195927996.png" alt="Firehouse Subs labor day marketing" width="400" height="493" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Firehouse-Subs-labor-day-marketing-e1504195927996.png 400w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Firehouse-Subs-labor-day-marketing-e1504195927996-350x431.png 350w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>Firehouse Subs took to Twitter to implore diners to use their day off to eat at the sandwich shop, tweeting a coupon good for a free medium sub with the purchase of an additional sub, chips, and a drink.</p>
<h2>5. Spaghetti Warehouse Brings The Restaurant Home</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10230" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/spaghetti-warehouse-labor-day-restaurant-marketing-e1504196271975.png" alt="spaghetti warehouse labor day restaurant marketing" width="500" height="535" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/spaghetti-warehouse-labor-day-restaurant-marketing-e1504196271975.png 500w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/spaghetti-warehouse-labor-day-restaurant-marketing-e1504196271975-350x375.png 350w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p>Rather than asking guests to dine in, Spaghetti Warehouse used Labor Day 2016 as an opportunity to publicize its family takeout meals, with a Family Feast for 4 special. &#8220;Family style&#8221; meals, which typically come with an entree and sides (enough to feed the whole family, naturally) have grown in popularity in recent years. For quick-service chains, they allow for a boost in sales during dinner, typically the least popular day-part for a drive-thru.</p>
<h2>6. Steakhouse Chains Offer Something for the Whole Family</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10227" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/steakhouse-labor-day-restaurant-marketing.png" alt="steakhouse labor day restaurant marketing" width="794" height="588" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/steakhouse-labor-day-restaurant-marketing.png 794w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/steakhouse-labor-day-restaurant-marketing-350x259.png 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/steakhouse-labor-day-restaurant-marketing-300x222.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/steakhouse-labor-day-restaurant-marketing-768x569.png 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/steakhouse-labor-day-restaurant-marketing-500x370.png 500w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/steakhouse-labor-day-restaurant-marketing-167x124.png 167w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/steakhouse-labor-day-restaurant-marketing-122x90.png 122w" sizes="(max-width: 794px) 100vw, 794px" /></p>
<p>In years past, Brazilian steakhouse Fogo de Chão has enticed the whole family to stop in on Labor Day weekend, by offering complimentary dining for all children 12 and under. Lone Star Steakhouse offered a similar promotion, with a coupon allowing kids to eat free with the purchase of an adult entree through Labor Day.</p>
<h2>7. Chipotle Aims To Bring Customers Back</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10238" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/chipotle-kids-eat-free-labor-day-e1504209904148.jpg" alt="chipotle-kids-eat-free labor day" width="500" height="317" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/chipotle-kids-eat-free-labor-day-e1504209904148.jpg 500w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/chipotle-kids-eat-free-labor-day-e1504209904148-350x222.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p>In an effort to lure customers and boost business after its reputation-destroying food safety scandal, Chipotle offered children ages 12 and under a free kids&#8217; meal with the purchase of a regular burrito, bowl, or salad during the month of September 2016. While it wasn&#8217;t explicitly about Labor Day, the burrito chain was able to piggy-back on the marketing push of September.</p>
<h2>8. Dairy Queen Commemorates the End of Summer</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10236" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/dairy-queen-labor-day-marketing-e1504209807571.png" alt="dairy queen labor day marketing" width="500" height="207" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/dairy-queen-labor-day-marketing-e1504209807571.png 500w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/dairy-queen-labor-day-marketing-e1504209807571-350x145.png 350w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p>As a culmination to Summer, Dairy Queen hosted a giveaway the day <em>after</em> Labor Day, offering free Oreo Frappes (one per customer) from 2 to 5 PM at participating locations. The freebie did double-duty, bringing customers in to Dairy Queen, and also promoting the chain&#8217;s &#8220;Hardest Working Happy Hour,&#8221; when specially-priced frozen drinks are available weekdays at, you guessed it, 2 to 5 p.m.</p>
<h2>9. A Celebrity Chef Puts a Spin on BBQ</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10239" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Graffiato-labor-day-marketing-e1504210474836.png" alt="Graffiato labor day marketing" width="500" height="611" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Graffiato-labor-day-marketing-e1504210474836.png 500w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Graffiato-labor-day-marketing-e1504210474836-350x428.png 350w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p>To put his signature Italian spin on a traditional Labor Day cookout, <em>Top Chef</em> alum Mike Isabella offers an Italian-style barbecue (complete with brisket, ribs, cacio e pepe pasta, baked white beans, and artichoke slaw) on Labor Day weekend at his DC restaurant, Graffiato.</p>
<h2>10. Baskin-Robbins Keeps It Cool</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10241" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Baskin-robbins-labor-day-restaurant-marketing-e1504210792382.png" alt="Baskin robbins labor day restaurant marketing" width="500" height="410" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Baskin-robbins-labor-day-restaurant-marketing-e1504210792382.png 500w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Baskin-robbins-labor-day-restaurant-marketing-e1504210792382-350x287.png 350w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p>Ice cream chain Baskin Robbins is doing double-duty this Labor Day, offering deals and promoting its app in the process. Deals like $2 off Polar Pizza and $1 off ice creams are only available to those who use the chain&#8217;s mobile app.</p>
<h2>11. Miami Resort Offers Flashy Specials</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10237" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Gilis-Beach-Club-labor-day-marketing-e1504209825808.png" alt="Gilis Beach Club labor day marketing" width="300" height="301" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Gilis-Beach-Club-labor-day-marketing-e1504209825808.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Gilis-Beach-Club-labor-day-marketing-e1504209825808-250x250.png 250w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Gilis-Beach-Club-labor-day-marketing-e1504209825808-100x100.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Gili&#8217;s Beach Club (located at Trump International Beach Resort) offers a slew of seasonal specials for the 2017 Labor Day weekend: in addition to apps like bourbon honey and Tabasco chicken wings served with cucumber ranch dip, there are &#8220;Big Kids&#8221; watermelon lemonades spiked with vodka and &#8220;No Labor&#8221; beer buckets for $20.</p>
<h2>LABOR DAY BY THE NUMBERS</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10235" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Labor-day-retail-spend-e1504208995916.png" alt="Labor day retail spend" width="500" height="398" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Labor-day-retail-spend-e1504208995916.png 500w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Labor-day-retail-spend-e1504208995916-350x279.png 350w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p>An estimated 25% of Americans will travel over Labor Day weekend; 128.5 million will enjoy a cookout; and the average Labor Day weekend shopper will spend $58 in the process. In fact, some surveys peg spend even higher, between $68 and $150 dollars. And while much of that shopping will be done online, a full 26% will be in-person (with 41% of transactions being completed both in-store and online).</p>
<p>In other words, the opportunity is great for restaurants, provided they can maintain their brand standards, focus on a range of advertising channels, and ensure they&#8217;re marketing to specific segments (among the <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/common-restaurant-marketing-mistakes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">countless other marketing tips </a>to consider).</p>

				<p>A restaurant marketing audit should be as common and as much a part of life for restaurant chains as a physical exam is for people. It’s something that should be done every 36-months as a standard routine.</p><p>The restaurant industry is an incredibly complex one. Add modern marketing to the mix (which is complex, in and of itself), and that challenge is magnified. In the past decade alone, media has evolved to a point where it would be nearly unrecognizable to the restaurant chains of 2007. Yet, many restaurant companies still parade yesteryear’s tactics and promotional approaches as up to date (‘well, we are posting it to Instagram now though and using hashtags,’ some rationalize).</p><p>Perhaps even more troubling is that many restaurant chains fail to perform periodic, top-to-bottom audits of their marketing objectives, strategies, and activities and carry-over last year’s plan with modest tweaks (on the opposite spectrum, for example, 3G Capital insists on Zero-Based Budgeting for brands it buys, like Burger King). With restaurant marketing budgets rapidly shifting toward digital, social, mobile, earned media, content marketing, and corporate social responsibility, it can be difficult to narrow the focus and find the right balance of traditional and new media, fresh approaches versus tried-and-true programs that should carry on.</p><p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-10034" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Restaurant-marketing-audit-recent-changes--1024x293.png" alt="Restaurant marketing audit recent changes" width="980" height="280" /></p><p>The fact that modern restaurant marketing has become so complex has not been lost on CEOs and CMOs. Many new “<a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-marketing-tips-and-tactics">marketing mandatories</a>” have emerged that require a CMO to have a commanding knowledge of not just the traditional and emerging marketing disciplines and specialized skills required, but how to apply them and integrate it all together with a seamless omnichannel integration strategy. The modern chain restaurant CMO must possess expert knowledge of positioning, messaging, and technical requirements spanning: digital, social, mobile, crisis communications, reputation management, <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/earned-media-restaurant-high-valuation">earned media</a>, content marketing, <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-loyalty-programs">loyalty</a> and CRM, branding and corporate identity, art and creative direction, broadcast, print, production and fulfillment, e-commerce and self-ordering technologies, field and local store marketing, <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/launching-a-new-menu">menu merchandising and design</a>, SEM/SEO, advanced analytics, and so much more.</p><p>These are just a few of the marketing disciplines involved, they must also master and lead all of that while simultaneously possessing expert and real-time insights (as well as long-range forecasts) for emerging consumer trends and evolving dining behavior, direct and indirect competitive threats, plus they need to manage to inform and enroll a long list of constituents such as colleagues, help effectuate employee morale and Associate Engagement programs, the media, investors, franchisees/franchisors, vendors, partners, and perform well in all of those ad hoc consensus-building committee meetings and special projects that pop up.</p><p>And, for many, this is intensified by what is usually a responsibility stretching many brands and geographies (in some cases, for our multi-national clients with dozens of countries and dozens of brands, it’s often a wonder to us how they keep their sanity as few others understand just how complex it all is; most still are expected to get even more done and with fewer resources).</p><p><em>But, sure, let’s have them conduct their own top-to-bottom marketing audit in addition to all of the aforementioned and flag everything they’re not doing, should be doing better, did wrong, and need to be doing in the future, and bring that back to the same CEO that asked for said performance appraisal. You see the challenge herein, we trust.</em></p><h2>What is a Restaurant Marketing Audit? What Should it Include?</h2><p>Companies — like countries — should have a constitution. A sacred and honored document that spells out the rules, promises, norms, laws, and aspirations for its people and stakeholders. We all know what this looks like for a country, but what does it mean for a company (and how does that relate to a restaurant marketing audit)?</p><p>A brand constitution goes beyond business plan jargon like a vision and mission. It should ultimately get to the “purpose” (beyond profits alone) of the company, its reason for being, how it improves the communities and constituents it serves (guests, associates/employees, investors, partners, etc.). It should define promises it makes to each.</p><p>It should also address important elements such as the Culture Manifesto for the company, the positioning (and competitive counter-positioning) strategy, the personality, and establish the norms and nomenclature of the company in a way that can be told through story and iconography that helps to instill the company virtues and values in a way that resonates on an emotional level.</p><p><em>We know you&#8217;re thinking, &#8220;Okay &#8230; you had me up to a point. This is starting to sound less tangible and more esoteric than I was expecting.&#8221; </em><em>Hang in there &#8230; </em></p><p>Before any proper marketing audit can be conducted, certain baselines and benchmarks must be established and known. Any advisor that jumps into quantifying performance and a gap analysis on marketing without getting clear about the bedrock of the brand is going to come back with a purely tactical checklist set of findings that can result in inconclusive and misleading findings. Also important to note here – the CMO/head of marketing can help you articulate all of this (if it hasn’t been done already), but the intent of it must be decided upon and defended at a board-level.</p><p>Now, assuming these things are in place, let’s move on to the meat and potatoes you are looking for.</p><p>The marketing audit should review all historical, current, and planned marketing activity to perform a comprehensive gap analysis and net out a prioritized list of improvement opportunities (for ‘current state’ and ‘future state’ planning). This means it should assess everything from the usage and efficacy to the relevance and cost/benefit analysis. It should address people, processes, tools, technology, systems, and infrastructure through the lens of performance and productivity, as well as an evaluation of both the tangible and intangible contributions to the company.</p><h2>The Questions to Ask During a Restaurant Marketing Audit</h2><p>As the saying goes, “There’s no point making more efficient that which shouldn’t be done at all.” Meaning, restaurant marketers are often carrying around a stale bag of tactics that are easy to get approval on while being seduced (and attempting to seduce others) into chasing the latest shiny thing of the day (yesterday it was Foursquare, today it’s Instagram and Snap; tomorrow it will be something else).</p><p>While we often advocate being an early adopter (as it can pay more in benefits of earned media than was even hoped for with base platform), most companies today are stretched too thin and trying to achieve ambitions within OPEX parameters that would require CAPEX-level investments. The new media is pushed down to younger team members our outsourced to cool agencies while the CMO is shouldered with the big picture messaging with the CEO and BOD. The result is often that tactical seems strategic and the truly strategic is put off to a future budget debate that happens in a room filled with purple elephants (things most people can see but far fewer want to risk political capital to address head-on).</p><p>Oh, right, back to the questions one should ask: there’s a <em>LOT</em> of them. The better the questions the better the answers. In other words, the more focused and skilled the questions are asked and answered through this process, the stronger shot you have of helping enable the right shared insights, understanding, and actionable plans that will be required to not only keep current but to leapfrog the competition and those in your category.</p><p>So, a few questions below, but there are literally hundreds to thousands of data points that must be evaluated at some level through such a process (good thing you only need to do it every three years or so, right?):</p><h3>Budget &amp; Allocation</h3><ul><li>How much should we allocate? Are we spending it in the right places? What’s the best allocation of the budget (across brands, media, geographies, times of the year)?</li><li>Which marketing channels are (now, and becoming) the most effective/least effective?</li><li>Do we have the right marketing chart of accounts? What of this should be CAPEX versus OPEX? What kind of OPEX requirements will we have in the years ahead to modernize and maintain a best-in-class marketing function and capabilities?</li></ul><h3>Measurement &amp; Management</h3><ul><li>Are we measuring the right metrics? Do we even have the capability to measure the ones we need to be measuring (in real-time)? Do our team members have the right goals, KPIs, and dashboards to monitor results and efficacy?</li><li>How do we know if the marketing is working and what to continue/discontinue, increase/decrease? Do we have the right internal and external benchmarks to compare against?</li><li>Are we providing the right insights to the rest of the company to help make them more effective and aware as well? Do executives get what they need? Do field and unit-managers get what they need? What about the communication of status and performance to/from our partners (franchisee’s/franchisor, investors, media, etc.)?</li><li>Do we have the right agencies, advisors, and analytical insights; not just from a technical point of view, but in terms of the wider issues (re)shaping our industry and our place in it?</li></ul><h3>Personnel &amp; Staffing</h3><ul><li>How are staff members performing in their current positions?</li><li>What tools and technology should they be provided with to improve their performance?</li><li>Who do we need (what positions and people), now and in the future?</li><li>How should our marketing department be structured to be more effective moving forward? By brand, geography, channel, campaign, something else?</li></ul><h3>Marketing Effectiveness</h3><ul><li>Are we using the proper messaging for competitive differentiation? Does it resonate on an emotional level (or sound like ‘me-too’ marketing)?</li><li>How is our company and its brands perceived? How could this perception be enhanced?</li><li>How should our marketing approach be similar or different across different regions? What about our pricing? Promotional strategy?</li><li>Does our company have an effective overall marketing strategy including digital and social media? Are there gaps within the marketing function? If so, how should priorities be established?

Over ten years ago, Pizza Hut was utilizing newspaper ads to market its pizza-shaped headphones. Today, the chain emphasizes its use of Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat — outlets that didn’t even exist in the 1990s.</p><p>Reorienting marketing operations to these changing environments and opportunities will require an investment, and a third party with an objective view and the know-how to dig deep, but the return on that will far outweigh the time or financial investment. In essence, an audit is meant to hold marketing dollars accountable, so they perform at the highest level. Not only can a thorough restaurant marketing audit increase a chain’s marketing efficiency and effectivity, it can have a tremendous effect on the bottom line, too.</p><h2>So, How Much Does it Cost?</h2><p>There are a lot of ways to answer this but a rule of thumb is “never spend a dime on marketing until you’ve invested at least a penny planning how to do it most effectively.” That fails to satisfy the curiosity though, of course. The more nuanced answer is that it depends on the complexity of the system and the resources that must be applied to having a team as or more experienced as your own apply a data-driven approach and rigorous analysis to historical, current, and future state evaluation and the development of actionable insights and recommendations.</p><p>Most companies simply aren’t doing most of the mandatories and this can be spotted at a 30,000-foot view. We typically recommend that every 36-months you will want to earmark roughly 5%–10% of that year’s marketing budget to such a process (expect a minimum of a $150k price tag for a qualified firm; most that perform this work for middle-market chains will be in the $150k–$1.5m range and not too well-suited to work with smaller organizations that cannot comfortably afford this level of investment due to their own cost constraints with regard to the time/team resources required to perform such work at the necessary levels).</p><h2>And How Long Does it Take?</h2><p>Depending on the size and complexity of your system – and the availability of data to analyze – such a process can run anywhere from six weeks to six months (our firm, for example, would typically sequence such a project over a 6 &#8211; 12-week period). Another factor will be geography and how much fieldwork the company performs on your behalf (field observations and analysis can often prove invaluable in identifying real-world usage cases, guest journey mapping, interviewing staff and management, facilitating consumer research, and so on).</p><h2>Is It Worth It?</h2><p>It often surprises us, even still, that some organizations spend tens of millions per year on marketing and go for years and years on end with a nagging feeling they’re not as efficient and effective as they could be, yet still are also reluctant to invest a tiny fraction of that budget to hold it accountable; to conduct a proper audit and invest in the analysis and plans that they know will be required to ensure relevance and high-performance in the future.</p><p>At the same time, the easiest way to assess and assure performance (present-state and future-plans) is to audit what’s most important and to allocate where resources will be most effective. Seems easy enough to extrapolate from this the value of endeavoring to audit and plan marketing with the sensibilities of any astute investor: an ounce of planning is worth a pound of prevention (and 20 grams of analysis is found in every ounce of planning).</p>					</div>

<h2>Chapter 1: Restaurant PR</h2>
<p>The fastest and best way to reduce costs for a restaurant is to boost sales. Learning how to market a restaurant and increase sales by just 2% is equivalent to a 10% reduction in costs.</p>
</header>
<p>I’m ready to help arm you (or if you’re a supplier – help you arm your customers or clients) with 10 of the restaurant PR you need I know to boost sales. To help make it all a little easier to digest and implement, this proven set of 10 strategies will be broken up into a 10 part series with one new recommendation going out per day (appearing first in my newsletter, so sign up today).</p>
<p>The recession has seemed to batter everyone’s spirits. The global recession truly is/was global. While we are seeing many emerging markets recover quickly and then start to accelerate again, much of the mature western markets (U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., and other parts of Europe) continue to lag. While we are thrilled for our clients in those emerging markets who are bursting at the seams with growth and possibility, we are also optimistic about the opportunities for clients in flat or falling markets. Fact is, the best time to gain better employees, grow market share, and outshine the competition is when the competition can’t afford to keep up. Recessions are often when you see the biggest gains in market share (just ask Carlos Slim who catapulted to the top spot of the world’s richest men in 2010 with about a $25 billion advantage over Bill Gates and Warren Buffett).</p>
<p>(More here on <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-recession" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how the restaurant industry benefits from a recession</a>.)</p>
<p>Okay, let’s begin exploring how to market a restaurant. We’ll start with a general premise: “Sales cure all that ails you.” It’s a lot easier to ride a bucking Bronco than to drag a dead horse. When you have healthy revenue growth, you can fix a lot of bugs and pesky problems others with flat or falling sales have to suffer. Here are a few of our go-to favorites when we need to get some quick restaurant PR wins for clients – and these are pretty universal so whether you run a mom and pop restaurant or a global chain, these can work for you too:</p>
<p>A well-placed story can be worth its weight in gold. Restaurant PR has entered a whole new era with the emergence of social media. Just five years ago, the only way to build a buzz in the media was with dedicated media relations teams and intoxicating pitches to elite journalists. While the fundamentals of media relations and importance of traditional media outlets have not become less important, the new media tools and vehicles to garner publicity have boomed. Just five years ago social networking barely showed up on the Internet traffic monitors, but today it is the bulk of the traffic on the Internet. Publicity and celebrity status are more in reach for foodservice organizations with skeleton crew marketing departments. This isn’t to say publicity itself is “easier” just to say that it’s more accessible now.</p>
<p>Whether you asked Ray Kroc of McDonald’s or the founders of Outback or even the more recent runaway success stories like Chipotle their founders will all tell you the same thing; they had buzz and PR wins that began mounting on top of one another and helped rocket them to the top. The restaurant marketing approaches billion-dollar chains use after they become billion-dollar chains aren’t the same ones they used when they were under that threshold. A commonality is a well-oiled restaurant PR machine.</p>
<p>Consumers trust what they see in the media. Anyone with a checkbook can buy an ad, but not just anyone gets written about. When a brand is worth <em>writing about</em>, it’s worth <em>talking abou</em><em>t</em>.</p>
<p>Traditional restaurant PR efforts targeting magazines and trade journals with long lead-times require a very professional, patient, and methodical approach. It takes time – and a great story – to romance traditional media. And traditional media is incredibly important. The long-term impact of a solid restaurant PR campaign can be an absolute game-changer. Fortunately, in the short term, for those seeking more immediate exposure for their story and offerings, new media and publicity strategies can be put in place that have an almost immediate result. The ideal approach is to blend both traditional PR and new media, but no restaurant should be without either. When considering how to market a restaurant remember that restaurant PR is a <em>necessity</em>, not a <em>nicety</em>.</p>
<h1>Chapter 2: SEO and Getting Found Online</h1>
</section>
<section id="2">Getting found online is essential for any restaurant and should be a priority when planning how to market a restaurant.</section>
<section>
All throughout human history, the most important source of information was “the personal source.” Today, the Internet has surpassed every other referral source in terms of importance to the modern-day consumer (seriously, someone did a scientific study of it, and <strong><em>TA-DA</em></strong> – 10,000 years of evolution of human communication irreversibly shifted in a decade).</p>
<p>Getting found online today is another one of those “mandatories of marketing<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />.” The acronym all too often thrown around by the marketing industry’s version of snake oil salesmen is “SEO” (Search Engine Optimization).</p>
<h3>What is SEO?</h3>
<p>What does it mean? SEO is about systematically winning the favor of Internet search engines (like Google, Yahoo, Bing, etc) and having them reward your site with top placement. Above the millions of web pages that were deemed relevant, yours was deemed most relevant. Now sure, you want to show up high – and probably do already – for what’s called a “vanity search” (which is when a company or person does a search for their own name,) but what about those other really important phrases like your trademarks, your signature items, your catering division, the name of your new rock star chef recently recruited away, and all of those other phrases like “Orlando Sunday Brunch,” etc.?</p>
<h3>What is the Goal of SEO?</h3>
<p>The goal with SEO is to leverage the power of online search and influence of the Internet to drive more traffic not just to your website, but more importantly – to your restaurants. For an independent restaurant, the phrases to optimize for are pretty straightforward. For chains, it is important to optimize not just at a corporate level, but on a unit-level too. “Search” is increasingly about geo-targeting. Each location needs to be optimized for what’s unique to that location. For example, Morton’s shouldn’t just optimize for their name, but for “Morton’s of Orlando” and even more specifically profitable unit-level phrases like “Orlando Steakhouses” and “Orlando Steakhouses with Private Dining”.</p>
<h3>What is SEM?</h3>
<p>You may also hear another acronym thrown around for SEO’s cousin – SEM (Search Engine Marketing). SEM is the online marketing world’s new and more appealing name for PPC (Pay Per Click). Think of it this way – SEO versus SEM is kind of like Public Relations versus Advertising; one you <em>earn</em> and one you <em>buy</em>. For those with big budgets and expectations for almost immediate results, SEM is the go-to tool for instantly boosting an online presence and driving traffic to your website (or promotions). Often, with SEM, you only pay for performance – which is where the earlier name of “Pay-Per-Click” came from. With the proliferation of online marketing strategies, tactics, and methods for building an online brand, the industry coined the new phrase SEM (both because it sounds better but also because it is more reflective of the fact that there are many other choices to marketing online than just buying pay-per-click ads on major search engines like Google, Yahoo, Bing, and others. For the purposes of this article though we’re just looking at SEO (more to come on SEM in the future).</p>
<p>We recommend to clients that they take a two-pronged approach that includes both SEO and SEM. SEM allows a new site or restaurant company new to building an online brand get some immediate traction and build traffic. SEM is costly though. While you often pay for performance, the little charges add up very quickly. Over the long term, if you build your SEO program effectively, you can reduce costly online advertising and pay per click to advance up the search results organically.</p>
<p>While the major search engines change their algorithms daily, there are a few timeless principles to consider for SEO. By the way, there are two types of SEO campaigns — one called “White Hat” and one called “Black Hat”. The first is the “good” way to win the favor of search engines and the latter is the sneaky stuff cheaters use to try and shortcut the search engine algorithms. We advise to only use “White Hat” approaches. Below are just a handful of the 100+ factors that play into search algorithms:</p>
<h3>1. Domain</h3>
<p>The name of the domain plays a big part in how well you do for certain phrases. For example, since my name and domain are the same, when you type in “Aaron Allen” in the search box you will find that <a href="http://www.aaronallen.com/">www.aaronallen.com</a> shows up in the top spot. This didn’t take much effort. There were few competitors (although I was surprised to learn how many more people there are in the world with my same name – I grew up thinking I was the only one). Building up the new domain for other phrases though (like “Restaurant Speaker”) take more effort. Other SEO tools must be employed (like a long tail URL which includes the keyword in it; for instance, the page <a href="https://aaronallen.com/restaurant-speaker">www.aaronallen.com/restaurant-speaker</a> has the keyword phrase in it which helps with the “domain” part of the algorithms. This SEO technique is often referred to as “long-tail URLs”). For each phrase you want to rank high for, build a dedicated page with the term in the URL extension.</p>
<h3>2. Domain Registration</h3>
<p>The length of time you register your domain is important. There was a rash of domain owners that would register a domain for the minimum length and build “link farms” and other “Black Hat” schemes and then once caught shut down the sites. Therefore, many of the search engines check to see how long the domain was registered for and reward those who paid a few years in advance (the maximum length is 10 years advance). Make sure your domain is booked at least 3–5 years out. In addition to how far out you register the domain, the original date of registration matters too; older domains have favor.</p>
<h3>3. Page Title</h3>
<p>The URL of the page is important but it is also important that you name the page for the phrase you’re going after as well. A page title is like the title of an article in a magazine; it should tell you what the content is all about.</p>
<h3>4. Title Tags</h3>
<p>The headlines and sub-headlines you use in the body of the page you are optimizing also count. These are often called h-tags (h2, H2, h-2, etc.) referring to the big/bold font you use. Just as on paper, when you put things in bold, underline them, etc, you are communicating that it is important to the reader – the search engine “spider” is reading the page too, just using the hidden language of computer code.</p>
<h3>5. Keywords</h3>
<p>The keywords can appear both in the actual copy and also in what are known as “meta tag descriptions”. The way I often describe this is to have you imagine that the search engine is an employer. This employer pays “spiders” to crawl the Internet all day and night. Each search engine may have millions of these spiders employed. The reason why when you type a phrase into Google and get 11 million results in a fraction of a second that it can deliver so many so fast is that it already knows the answer to the question. Meaning, for any phrase, Google had its spiders find the results months ago and the answer is just waiting there for you to ask a question.</p>
<p>So how do the spiders know what to rank high? Well, taking the analogy further, think of all these 100+ search engine factors used in a search engine’s algorithm as “spider food”. Some of the food “tastes” better to the spiders than others. The more “food” you put out there, and the better tasting it is, and the more often you put it out there, the more you train those spiders to come to your site expecting tasty food and the more they brag about you to their employers – the search engines. In other words, put lots of quality content on your website frequently – just like you’re trying to turn a stray cat (or search spider) into a pet. Okay, all of that to say, “keywords” are really tasty “spider food.” So tasty, in fact, you can’t feed them too much (or put too many keywords) on a single page or you’ll make them sick. Limit keywords. Focus on one per page and don’t “stuff” the page (or overuse keywords).</p>
<h3>6. Image Tags</h3>
<p>Spiders can’t see images. While photos, videos, and “flash” on a webpage look great to human visitors, the spiders are reading the page differently. Think of them as reading your site in Braille. They “crawl” over the site and read the code. Some website designers will haphazardly use weird file names for the content they put up when a simple technique of naming the images the same as the phrase you’re optimizing for could make a big difference. For instance, on your “Sunday Brunch” page you’re trying to climb up the engines with, instead of using a file name like “<em>image91211.jpeg</em>” just renaming it to “<em>Allens-Seafood-Restaurant-Sunday-Brunch-Panama-City.jpeg</em>” can give you a big boost.</p>
<h3>7. Inbound Links</h3>
<p>When other sites link to yours it gives you a nice boost. Both the quantity and quality of the links matter; but between the two quality matters more. By quality, I mean that the search engines give a type of credibility score and if the other websites that link to yours have high credibility (i.e. you get a link to your site from the Wall Street Journal; you are listed on a site review site voting for best Sunday Brunch and get lots of links to your Sunday Brunch landing page; etc); and also all of the other factors above – if the sites linking to yours do all of the above (and a whole lot more) right, that increases the quality of the link and therefore your score for this aspect of SEO performance.</p>
<p>The above list is <em>very</em> limited due to length, complexity of the subject, and modern-day attention divs. If it is any indication of how much is involved in all of this, I do a full eight (8) hour workshop on SEO and barely get to all of the big stuff. The Internet is growing at such an incredible rate of geometric progression that the methods for getting a single webpage to stand out among the billions of other pages on the site has become a specialization within a specialization.</p>
<p>This brings me to one of the important points on the subject of SEO. Many restaurant executives and marketers (understandably) don’t have the time to become experts at SEO and farm it out and think it’s being taken care of by the agency. Often the company that designed the restaurant website says “we are going to do some SEO as part of the design and submit your site to all of the big search engines”. This sounds like it’s “handled”. The area of design and digital marketing has become so complex though that it requires distinctly different specialists to build a modern-day restaurant website and SEO program. Some restaurants have one jack of all trades build the whole thing. In actuality though, usually, the best “designers” are not the best “programmers” – and vice versa. And in all likelihood, while both may know a little about the other’s job – and think they know about SEO – it is such a complex, competitive, specialized and important area of marketing that it often requires more than what the typical designer or programmer can bring to the table. For the big brands out there they often have teams of SEO specialists which are totally separate from their SEM specialists.</p>
<p>Okay, that may have overcomplicated what I was trying to say. The main point is that good SEO – like a good public relations campaign — is about consistency of effort. It’s not really a “set it and forget it” aspect of marketing. That said, if you stick with it, you can earn those really top spots in the search engines and win swarms more customers than your competitors. The search engines make it hard to climb to the top; which is challenging when you’re just starting out but terrific when you rise above the competition.</p>
<p>Don’t let the complexity of this scare you away from learning more about it though. Keep in mind this is just a single article on a really big subject. The best way to eat an elephant is one bite at a time. Likewise, SEO is something you can learn just a little about each day. Don’t be intimidated by it. Gaining just a basic understanding and applying a few simple techniques can really pay off for restaurant companies of all sizes. SEO is like planting a garden – you need to start <em>before</em> you’re hungry, but it’s never too late to start and will almost certainly pay off in the long run if well-tended.</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Web 2.0</p>
</section>
<section id="3">Embracing Web 2.0 is essential for every restaurant. The National Restaurant Association found that almost 40% of all restaurant customers will visit the restaurant’s website before they dine there for the first time. Staggering. And that poll is a couple of years old. The importance of a website for boosting restaurant revenue is only increasing and certainly isn’t diminishing.</p>
<p>While hundreds of thousands of restaurants around the world now have some form of online presence, many are still in the old Web 1.0 era of static brochure-ware sites. A million dollars or more may have been spent on the beautiful new renovation or build-out, but 40% of the restaurants&#8217; customers are making a go/don’t-go decision based on yesterday’s El Cheapo website.</p>
<p>I’m often surprised how many entrepreneurs brag about how little they spent on their website or glow with pride (like a proud parent of their child’s finger painting now on the home refrigerator) that their nephew was able to build their site over the weekend for $50 and a six-pack of beer (we like to call this “nephew marketing” – and please note; my comments aren’t meant to be derogatory to others but cautionary to you – this isn’t an area of your business that should be left to novices or relegated to the interns because it’s some less important and periphery marketing “project”).</p>
<p>To be sure, how to market a restaurant website isn&#8217;t about how much you spend it is about strategy. The point is that an effective web strategy and embracing Web 2.0 shouldn’t be some afterthought or the type of thing one can put off because it’s not as understandable as other parts of the business or not a glaring red light on the executive dashboard. The point is that if you and your organization are serious about competing in the restaurant industry of tomorrow, you either must know this stuff or bring on some people who do because it is not going away and it won’t get any easier to understand or less important going forward.</p>
<h2>Your Website Should Be Your +1</h2>
<p>Your website should be viewed as your “+1”. Meaning – if you have one restaurant think of it as having a restaurant +1. If you have 1,000 restaurants, think of it as having 1,000 +1. The “+1” is your online location. It can’t be an afterthought. In fact, if you do happen to have 1,000 locations, your website is very likely the most important location of all of them you have (as it will host more media, investors, analysts, franchisees, industry influencers, etc than any single one of your other locations).</p>
<p>You don’t have to spend on it what a restaurant unit costs (although some of the big chains spend that and more these days), but you do have to approach the design, construction, maintenance, and future planning of your online presence with the same level of detail you did with your physical locations.</p>
<p>It makes no sense to serve a $48 Ribeye on a paper plate and give customers a plastic “spork” to eat it with. Likewise, it makes no sense to spend money on traditional advertising at the expense of your website. Dollar for dollar, digital marketing almost always packs more punch today than traditional yester-year advertising.</p>
<h2>How to Market a Restaurant in Web 2.0</h2>
<p>Now how to engage in Web 2.0 is a big subject with lots of moving pieces. I love discussing it and teaching the principles to others. I won’t do it the disservice of trying to sum it all up in a paragraph. I will be posting much more on this subject in the future to my <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog">blog</a> and break this subject up into smaller more digestible pieces. The call to action here though is just that you get thinking and researching and moving toward embracing the idea of “Web 2.0” Many experts still argue about where it’s at and where it’s going, but you won’t find a single one that would suggest it’s going away.</p>
<h2>A Few <em>Must-Have </em>Elements for Any Restaurant Website Include:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Social Media: Add your account links for Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. It is advisable to put these in the footer or global content area of the site so web-savvy visitors don’t have to search for them. Also, it is often advisable (depending on who is managing the account) to put a “feed” of your social media on your website too (streaming your Twitter updates, for example). This helps cross-pollinate your accounts and engage with customers in prospective customers where they are already.</li>
<li>Full Address: A surprising number of restaurants list only the phone number or street address but doesn’t say which city or state. By showing the full address, your website is more likely to get indexed in review sites, geo-search results, and various phone applications consumers use to find new restaurants.</li>
<li>Map &amp; Directions: While many smartphones and mobile devices allow users to click an address on a webpage and pull up separate directions, some Internet browsers do not. Therefore, to save visitors from re-typing your address into a separate mapping tool, set up your site so with just a few clicks they can see where you are located and get directions from where they are now. One of the best tools for this is Google Maps integration.</li>
<li>Mobile Compliance: There are more mobile phone users in the world that PC users surfing the Internet. It is essential that your menu can be viewed from popular mobile browsers. Have a full mobile compliance test run on your website to be sure it works across the various browser types. For instance, many websites still use Adobe Flash which isn’t supported by many Apple devices (rumor is Steve Jobs is blocking Adobe to weaken the company and do a takeover, so this may change soon – until it does though, be sure your site works on mobile and tablet versions — two of the fastest selling products in human history that can’t be ignored).</li>
<li>Media Room: Journalists considering your company for a feature story (maybe a profile on your hot new chef or one of those coveted trade magazine articles about your new franchise plans) will often go first to the website. Make sure to have a publicist take a look at your online media room to be sure it meets all the necessary requirements (press kit, press releases, b-roll, high-res photography, bios, company history, etc).</li>
<li>Blog: You can cancel dependence on an outside web design firm by using free blogging software as the backbone of your site. This won’t work for all sites, but you’d be surprised how much you can do yourself using a service like <a href="http://wordpress.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WordPress</a>. While we have teams of designers, with our website based on WordPress, we can make our own posts and update/change content without any help. You could do the same (quick price changes, adding new specials, improving copy, etc.) and save that 24-48 hour delay that’s usually there with getting the IT department or outside design firm to make the little change for you. You will want to have a professional do the initial design, but let them know you want it set up on a tool that allows you to make your own changes add blog posts. Also, blogs are a great way to keep adding SEO content.</li>
<li>Data Capture: Your customers WANT to hear from you. Help make it easy for them to stay in touch by offering a free newsletter sign-up form on your website. Also, do plenty of data capture off-line too (more on that in a future blog post).</li>
<li>Optimized Landing Pages: You don’t need to optimize every page of your site; just every page you want to be found easily. The more content you put on your site – and the more frequently you do it – the more hooks you have floating in the Internet ocean of prospective customers, employees, journalists, analysts, investors, etc.</li>
<li>Menu: As stated above, the menu should be viewable from phone, but I wanted to add here another suggestion – make it easy to email a direct link to your menu. Many times, friends will want to suggest a restaurant and show a menu to get others excited. Some sites bury the menu in the site or have a URL address that is too long to either re-type or forward. Consider a share tool to make it easy to email the link or post to social networking sites (like Twitter and Facebook).</li>
</ul>
<h2>A Few Optional Elements to Consider for Your Restaurant Website (These Vary by Brand/Concept), Include:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Video: Studies show that video produces much higher conversion rates than plain text or email alone. If you have the budget to produce a professional video do so and put a compressed (easy to load) copy on your site to help personalize the brand. Don’t try this at home – oftentimes amateur videos of food can do more harm than good. There are plenty of online video companies out there these days that can do online videos for as little as $500 turnkey.</li>
<li>Restaurant Locator: For chains – beyond just offering a directional tool – consider a locator tool. One note though, be sure not to restrict it to ONLY allowing the locator. I have been frustrated to no end trying to order online with Papa John’s in markets where I didn’t readily know the zip code – they lock you out and restrict access altogether. It is too restrictive and is doing more to restrict buying than encourage it.</li>
<li>Financial: Public companies have strict financial reporting guidelines and many of them already have a robust financial section on their site for investors and analysts. For private companies, this is still a good place to post your more favorable results. Whether you’re looking for new investors, to be featured in a business news article, or looking to build a positive picture of the company, having a section on your site to communicate your results and plans is often a good idea.</li>
<li>FTP/ Support Login: For multi-unit operators, we encourage that you have a private log-in section for your field managers. Whether your system is corporate or franchised or both, there is always information to share and exchange. Doing this digitally is the best approach. Some companies do so via email but this can be dangerous. Creating a log-in section, you can post information with more protections; such as restricting access, tracking file histories, allowing files to be seen but not distributed, or updating something like a 300-page operations manual in an instant rather than mailing out new printed versions every time there is a slight change needed. This is also a great place to store your corporately approved and encouraged marketing materials for managers or franchises to pull down and produce locally.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your restaurant website is the second most important piece of marketing collateral you have second only to your menu. It must be viewed as an organic and evolving component of your brand rather than a static and abstract communications tool. Again, think of it as your +1 and have it managed just like the unit-level is managed. Someone has to keep up with it and stay on top of it like the restaurant restrooms; only this restroom is on full display and not just every customer but every prospective customer enters through the restroom first.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4: Menu Engineering</h2>
<p>The core of how to market a restaurant is your menu. Everything from the kitchen design to marketing to hiring to location strategy – it’s all rooted in the menu. How many items should there be? Where do we buy our ingredients? How do we price our menu? Is there a gap between our theoretical and actual food cost and if so how did it happen? What should we discontinue and what should we expand on or enhance? Should we do a separate lunch and dinner menu or one all-day menu? How can we increase our margins without just a blanket price increase that may scare off our customers or reduce their visit frequency? The answers to all of these questions are pursued in the process of menu engineering and analysis.</p>
<p>Think of menu engineering as the CSI (you know – that Crime Scene Investigators series on TV…many of my readers are outside the U.S. – 123 countries last month – not sure if CSI is in all of them) of restaurant menu strategy. At any rate, what I’m trying to get at is that menu engineering is the “science” part of the culinary arts. It’s about exhaustive analysis of menu sales and profitability where all the myriad of data points are tabulated and cross-tabulated and studied; all toward the intent of yielding actionable insights on how to make a restaurant menu more profitable to the restaurant and relevant to the consumer.</p>
<p>The process of restaurant menu engineering reveals significant trends, insights, “profit siphons”, and opportunities for item line-extensions and new item introductions. There are several components to menu engineering including:</p>
<h2>1. Menu Profitability Analysis</h2>
<p>Menu profitability analysis delves into the cracks and corners of menu sales performance to uncover hidden gems of untapped or under-leveraged profit potential. Remember that scene from “A Beautiful Mind” where Russell Crowe’s character sees volumes and reams of numbers fall away and numerical patterns, mathematical theories, and an exciting new, game-changing hypothesis emerge from the chaos? That’s what can happen with menu profitability analysis. Okay, I romanticized it a bit – and at times the process of menu profitability analysis can make one feel as nutty as Crowe’s character was in that movie – but I can say honestly that at times you do have these eureka moments where numbers crumble and behind them you see patterns that would otherwise not have revealed themselves. You don’t have to be an accountant or math-wiz to come to enjoy menu profitability analysis. If you like a Sherlock Holmes film or crossword puzzles or snorting around in the backyard with a metal detector, you may like doing menu profitability analysis. Whether you like it or not though, if you want to increase sales and profits for your restaurant organization, you or someone who works for you needs to go on the needles-in-a-haystack-hunt that is menu profitability analysis.</p>
<p>How do you do it? Good question. I’ll stop with making the homework sound like a fun game and try to succinctly describe how you do it and what mantras to say out-loud as you’re doing it.</p>
<p>The idea is that “you deposit dollars, not percentages”. The standard “target” food cost is roughly 30% (lower for QSR’s and higher for, say, a casual dining steakhouse). Some items on your menu will yield a lower food cost and therefore a higher percentage profitability. But, which “renter” (my “renter” analogy closes this article, but go with me for now) do you give the prime space to – the one who pays you a bigger percentage of their paycheck or the one who pays you a big rent regardless of how much or little of their paycheck it was?</p>
<p>A profitability analysis of your menu will show you which items are (enter any variety of catch-phrase ways various consultants have come up with to call the four quadrants in a standard economic two-by-two diagram, here): #1) high in sales quantity and unit profitability, #2) high in sales quantity but not unit profitability, #3) high in unit profitability but not sales quantity, #4) low in unit sales and unit profitability. Essentially, what all of this tells you is – on a category by category basis – #1) which items to make more prominent on the menu and/or find “line extensions” and new variations of to promote in the future as LTO’s and future permanent add-ons, #2) which items to “re-engineer” so that they become more profitable (like adding bacon to the standard cheeseburger as an option whereby both the price and gross margin are increased), #3) which items to consider giving a “promotion” on the menu into better real estate so they can shine (and a number of other techniques to take high margin items that are low in sales quantity and increasing the quantity – or just realizing they are too unique to go mainstream and doing something else with them), #4) which menu items aren’t paying their fair share and are deadbeats that should be evicted.</p>
<p>Whew! That was a lot to sum up (and to absorb) in a single paragraph. While I realize some of my readers are rolling their eyes and thinking “child’s play”, please keep in mind our clients have ranged in sales volume from $250,000 to $12,000,000,000 (yes, 12-Billion) and we try to offer content relevant to all ends of the spectrum. Plus, even at the high end of the spectrum, you will concede sometimes this stuff is easier to just discuss and comprehend on an intellectual level than it is to actually produce. Let’s just say it like this – menu profitability analysis is commensurately difficult to the complexity of your restaurant organization but it is commensurately beneficial to endeavor to perform the analysis, make sense of the results, and effectuate the proper changes inside of your organization.</p>
<p>Whether you love or hate menu profitability analysis; whether you do it yourself or delegate it to someone else; whether this analysis is done on a single unit or a multi-national chain; the importance and necessity is equal.</p>
<h2>2. Competitive Menu Analysis</h2>
<p>Menu pricing strategy doesn’t happen in a vacuum. Naturally, it is important to study your own theoretical food costs and profitability targets, but this analysis must often be weighed in the context of the competitive landscape.</p>
<p>A competitive menu analysis is a study of price, portion, preparation, and presentation of comparable menu items for the competition as well as an overall general segment benchmark of how you stack up against others in your industry category and segment. This is done by conducting a “by-category” and itemized comparison of the competitive set and non-competitive benchmarks.</p>
<p>For example, you would take your appetizer category and list all items to see your highest-priced, lowest-priced, and total quantity of items in that category. Then you stack the same information for the competitors and benchmarks. This helps you see how you compare in terms of actual pricing, “perceived pricing”, variety (too many items and you may be carrying bloated inventory or make it confusing to customers to sort through, but too few items and it may have an impact on dining frequency due to limited choice).</p>
<p>Some parts of this type of analysis are very much scientific and some are more an art form to compare. In general, my feeling on competitive analysis is that the goal should be a menu (and brand overall) that isn’t easily comparable. When it is, often the two compete on price rather than value.</p>
<h2>3. Inventory Issues</h2>
<p>Inventory issues play into an overall menu engineering program and consideration for menu evolution. This would include considerations such as make/buy analysis, inventory turns and par levels, utilization reports (how many SKUs in your inventory, spread against how many vendors, etc) to determine if cost savings may be found with changes to the menu in terms of size, quantity, yield, and general procurement strategy.</p>
<h2>4. Restaurant Industry Trends and Menu Trends</h2>
<p>This is one of the areas that we see the big chains get off track more so than the independents or regional chains. With all of their armies of analysts, marketers, researchers, and seemingly endless budgets; big chains are by nature slower moving and less inclined to want to see seismic industry or consumer dining behavior change happen. Why? Well, imagine you have 35,000 restaurants and you have to turn all of them on a dime – for a franchise company that’s like getting 35,000 kindergarteners with tempers and lawyers to gleefully follow the teachers every direction when on a field trip (it can be done, but that is one heck of a teacher…uh, hem, miracle-worker of a restaurant CEO).</p>
<p>The mega-chains work on at least an 18-month planning schedule. Some fads (you should not chase “fads” but should prepare for “trends”) come and go in less time. That said, the greatest threat to the big guys and greatest opportunity for the mid-sized chains down through independents is to move faster to identify and respond to emerging restaurant trends that are sustainable. I have a blog post (or a couple) dedicated to this and the idea of “the origin of restaurant trends” that I encourage you to read. The point here though is that effective menu engineering must consider not just what can be “proven” in the here-and-now, but what assumptions there are for the future. All too many restaurant chains became casualties conducting their menu engineering analysis based on what was “true today” but ended up losing out because they didn’t see “what would be” and once that “came to be” it was too late because their ship was too big to change course as fast as was required to become relevant in time; especially since they were working on an 18-month calendar but were already 36-months behind the seismic shift.</p>
<p>Another way I like to say all of this is that “Starbucks would never have been born in a focus group.” We can all look at Starbucks today and applaud Shultz as a genius CEO; but if most of his same cheerleaders were asked in 1971 if what would come to be would have come to be, they would have asked for him to have a CAT scan. What Shultz did was part art and part science and part entrepreneurial bravery. He didn’t point to what was to build his case; he built a story and vision of what could-be. The Starbucks menu has evolved, but even at the start it wasn’t about what was proven to be sell-able prior or even at the time – it was a bet on what could happen in the future with solid category leadership. Likewise, as you consider your own menu strategy – which is at the core of your entire foodservice company strategy – think not just on what has worked up until now, but on what could be the future. Dream as bold as you like. Success favors the bold. You could be thinking of your neighborhood or your entire category of the industry. Or, maybe bolder still – creating an entirely new category (which is what the truly GREAT ones did – name one, that’s what they did).</p>
<h2>5. Other Operational Issues</h2>
<p>Naturally, there are a wide range of other considerations that play in to fully “engineering” a new menu. There are plenty of other factors chains must consider such as seasonality and availability of ingredients, consistency of product across various markets where different suppliers/distributors may be needed, the considerations associated with having an established corporate commissary or centralized culinary operating model versus decentralized – there’s a lot to it. For purposes of this series, I am limiting the purview of menu engineering to a restricted scope which can be accomplished without a total overhaul of the restaurants purchasing, supply chain, kitchen layouts, etc.</p>
<p>Menu engineering can be (in a very simplified nature for chain executives reading this) conducted by a single person and still yield powerful insights that can influence the entire organization. My intent with this article is to suggest that no matter the size of the restaurant system, menu engineering is more than a back-of-house or “culinary department” effort; menu engineering is a critical aspect of the marketing department’s scope of work too. The menu being the core of the entire operation means that ALL levels of the organization can play a part in the overall menu “analysis”. For certain though – whether pursued by an inter-departmental team, or a single owner/operator, or mandated by a forward-looking chain CEO – menu engineering is one of the surest ways to improve sales and profitability in the short and long term. No proper discussion about over-arching programs to drive sales can be complete without also factoring in the overall menu strategy – and that starts with a fact-based and analytical approach to menu engineering.</p>
<p>An easier way to look at all of this is to think of yourself as a landlord and every item on your menu a tenant. Like with all real estate, some locations are more valuable than others. In a three-panel menu, the center of the middle panel is your “Boardwalk” (or prime, most valuable space) and the right panel bottom is your “Baltic Avenue” (or “menu Ghetto”). The restaurant menu engineering process is an analysis to help you determine who is paying their fair share and who needs to pay more or be evicted.<br />

<h2>Chapter 5: Menu Engineering &amp; Design Considerations</h2>
</header>
<p>The single most important marketing collateral a restaurant possesses is its menu. One of the surest ways to effectively and measurably increase sales, profits, and guest satisfaction scores in a manner that is both quick and sustainable is to roll out a new menu. The menu should function as a tour guide and prove to be the best salesperson in your company. <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/menu-engineering-margins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Menu engineering</a> and design is the perfect marriage of both the science and art of successful restauranting. If you look at any lauded and successful restaurant turnaround, you’ll see signs of the CEO focusing on the inside and working outward; and find more specifically that a new menu was at the heart of the brand renaissance.</p>
<p>We adamantly believe menu engineering and design requires multi-disciplined team approaches. The process must be rooted in your operational capabilities, brand platform, and culture so it demands involvement from nearly all departments (finance, culinary, marketing, operations, etc). It can’t be done in a vacuum and yield its fullest potential. That said, hiring outside experienced and specialized help can expedite the process and facilitate more cross-departmental collaboration, contribution and buy-in. If you’d like a complimentary assessment of your menu – send us the current in-use version of your menu and cover letter. We’d be happy to proffer some thoughts and suggestions.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6: Signature Items</h2>
</header>
<p>Part Six of Boosting Restaurant Revenue explores how focusing on just a few key signature items can turn the tables quickly for under-performing brands and further propel growth-minded restaurant companies.</p>
<h2>In this issue we’ll cover:</h2>
<ol>
<li>How signature items are used in turnarounds</li>
<li>How signature items are used to create category leaders</li>
<li>What’s the difference between a signature item and a menu strategy</li>
<li>Why signature items are necessary for owning an industry category</li>
<li>What the British pub failures can teach us about menu strategy; and why the American breakfast category may suffer a similar fate</li>
<li>Who I think is one of the best turnaround guys in the industry and how he does it</li>
<li>My recommendation on the best place to inspire your plate presentations</li>
<li>How I boosted one restaurant’s sales and profits by threatening customers with a “curse”</li>
<li>What the Pantagonian Toothfish can teach you about marketing</li>
<li>Which 11 restaurant industry trends to consider when brainstorming new signature items</li>
</ol>
<p>All of this and much more in a fully-packed Part Six; let’s begin!</p>
<h2>Signature Items for Turnarounds</h2>
<p>If you study it, you will find that nearly every successful restaurant turnaround had a new menu strategy as the cornerstone of their brand renaissance. At the center of a new menu strategy is the “Signature Item”. A signature item can be leveraged not only for successful turnarounds. In fact, one could argue that signature items are what created category leaders in virtually every industry segment.</p>
<h2>Signature Items for Category Leaders</h2>
<p>The strategy of focusing on signature items isn’t just for those restaurant brands seeking a turnaround. Far from it. In fact, if you look at the top players in the industry – category by category – you will see that in nearly every case they have something that they are absolutely known for. Examples? PF Chang’s = Lettuce Wraps. Outback = Blooming Onion. Sure, others offer knock-offs of these items, but the credit for “owning it” goes to them for claiming them, focusing on them, and making a commitment to owning them. You can of course also look back at older examples such as: McDonald’s becoming the world’s largest foodservice company by focusing on the burger and fries (countless chains do that now but McDonald’s pioneered it as a “signature”). Burger King focused on “flame broiled” decades ago as competitive positioning against McDonalds and became the #2 burger chain. KFC owns the chicken bucket. Chick-fil-A owns the chicken sandwich. Zaxby’s owns fried chicken fingers (someone else pioneered what Zaxby’s is doing but didn’t leverage it properly; Zaxby’s came along and owned it such that now the originators of that concept look like the copy-cats). Want more recent? Kogi BBQ is one of the most recent emerging brands and they hands-down own “Korean BBQ”. What’s Korean BBQ? Exactly! Kogi more or less invented it. Now they own it and they are reaping the benefits of innovation. Sometimes the signature item can be so successful it creates a whole new industry category.</p>
<h2>Sometimes a Signature Item Isn’t an Item but Rather a Signature Menu Strategy</h2>
<p>In some cases, “signature” can go beyond a single item. For example, Chipotle isn’t necessarily known for a single signature item that defines them but rather an entire menu strategy/philosophy that defines them and has become their signature. “Food with Integrity”. Today, you can’t hear someone mention a focus on quality ingredients using sustainable practices and a focus on the source of the food without thinking of Chipotle. They claimed it. They own it. Note: I use Chipotle as an example frequently because they were the top-performing restaurant stock of 2010, are widely known, and are a really clear cut-example; but they are not the only one we see “doing it right.”</p>
<p>Another example of a menu strategy becoming its signature is the 1980’s campaign by Domino’s to deliver in 30 minutes or less – it was bold, they owned it, and they changed the entire pizza delivery industry while becoming a leader in it (notably struggling as of late since they lost their focus on what their menu strategy is actually).</p>
<h2>Why is it Called “Signature” in the First Place?</h2>
<p>The notion behind an item being “signature” is that it should be like a person’s actual signature. It’s unique, defining; it’s expressive; it’s artistic; and it’s “the bottom line”. A signature also implies a declaration (such as John Hancock’s signing of the Declaration of Independence) and a promise. When you put your signature on a document you are giving your word, staking your reputation, aligning yourself with a certain philosophy, ideal, or acknowledging an acceptance of terms.</p>
<p>I know you know all of this, but read this again through the lens not of what a signature on a document means but a <strong><em>signature item</em></strong> means to your restaurant brand. Get it? It’s a pretty big deal. So, in that view, do you own a category-killer signature item? If not, now’s the time to invent it. If so, get even more credit for it. As Winston Churchill once said, “If you ever have a point to make, don’t try to be subtle or clever. Hit the point once, twice, and a third time with a tremendous whack!”</p>
<h2>Signature Items Can Deliver on All Important Metrics</h2>
<p>Given that a signature item can be leveraged to take startups from unknowns to category leaders and be used with equal effectiveness to turnaround a large and stalled restaurant system, it is understandably too big of a subject to fully explore in the course of a single article. The point here isn’t to exhaust the subject or give a step-by-step critical path for implementation. Rather, the intent here is to help remind you of what you already know and perhaps see it differently so you’re motivated to look really closely at your own signature item/menu strategy. This is a big topic with immense power and potential for strengthening a restaurant brand, category leadership, revenue growth, profit maximization, employee morale, customer satisfaction, and word-of-mouth marketing. Wow! Anything that can simultaneously impact all of that definitely has to be at the heart of strategic brand leadership. Right?</p>
<h2>Below are a Number of Other Examples, Thought-Starters, Case Studies, and Best Practices</h2>
<h2>What British Pubs Can Teach Us</h2>
<p>After the 2008 recession British pubs were closing up faster than clams chased by a screeching otter. Dozens have closed each and every week since the recession. It was enough to drive the public to sob over a drink – and they did – but instead of to a pub, they went home. I don’t mean to at all make light of the devastation and ravaging of the British pub sector. What happened actually had us all here gasping and sighing and feeling nothing but remorse and empathy for those operators impacted. A few years after the worst of it though, this can be reviewed as a case study and lessons gleaned that can help both those who remain there in the UK and also others around the world. For what happened was, in some ways, avoidable for thousands of operators. The lessons learned are applicable to any restaurant system and particularly useful for those operators in mature or declining industry sectors.</p>
<ol>
<li>Too Much Alike: You can throw a rock in London and hit a pub — but, for many, the only differentiation was the sign out front or which side of the street it was on. There was hardly a motivation to cross the road. They had no signature items or distinguishable points of difference.</li>
<li>Failure to Study/Adapt to Trends: Beer has been falling behind for years. Wine and spirits were growing overall consumption volumes and simultaneously cannibalizing the beer category. Rather than adapt their menus, they stuck with what had worked before not what was going to work in the future. I couldn’t understand this one – wine and spirits have higher gross margins so why didn’t they hope for this trend even before the consumers opted for it?</li>
<li>Commodity: A bottled beer is hard to differentiate. Sure, you can perhaps get your beer colder or try to appeal with a better atmosphere, but short of that the only other way to make it different is with price. Yuck! Competing on price is a terrible approach. Any given day of the week someone else can always beat you on price. No one can consistently be the lowest priced and still have any margin remaining. The consumers this approach attracts will simply follow the deal like a swarm of locust follows the new crops. You can rent this customer but never establish real loyalty.</li>
<li>Something Else Became More Convenient: There is a saying “One thing you can never do too much of in business is make it too easy to buy from you”. Consumers flopped out of their office and onto a pub stool for quite a while, but eventually, off-premise marketers and retailers made drinking at home more convenient and relevant.</li>
<li>Beer Makers Homogenized Them: As the margins dwindled, profit-starved pubs were easy targets for beer marketers to buy them, in a way. The pub needed a renovation and marketing support so the beer marketers supplied them with free chairs, tables, taps, promotional materials, window signs, and more. “Here’s something special for you”…and your competitor next door. The deteriorating unit economics had them go along with it. They became homogenized.</li>
<li>Failure Associations: When “pubs” are closing by the thousands it’s time to reinvent who/what you are to be more relevant than a “pub”. This would have been the perfect time to re-conceptualize the menu strategy to update for new emerging trends and also create an entirely new “category”. This approach would have gotten huge publicity and driven tremendous unit volume for anyone smart enough to do it.</li>
</ol>
<p><img title="American Breakfast Joints" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/american-breakfast1.jpg" alt="how to market a restaurant - American Breakfast Joints" width="300" /></p>
<h2>American Breakfast Joints</h2>
<p>What’s the difference between Waffle House and Huddle House? How about between Denny’s and Perkin’s? In the breakfast category, Cracker Barrel has a real point of difference. The others in this category seem to cluster together with how they name their menu items, design their menus, promote themselves and a whole lot more. This is pretty common in maturing sectors. There’s a sort of homogenization that occurs as they huddle together to find safety from sagging sales and relevance. Then, the inevitable happens. Consolidation.</p>
<p>We saw this before with the popular cafeteria-style format that worked up until the 1980s for companies like Piccadilly and (formerly) Morrison’s. They grew big, failed to innovate, homogenized themselves so they were indistinguishable from their competitors, the category matured, consolidated, and is now a shadow of itself. Shoney’s is now trying hard to make a turnaround but it may be too little too late – especially if they don’t do something really bold in terms of innovation and new product development. They have a slim chance but if they really focused on the right strategy, a single signature item could help transform perceptions of their menu and ultimately their brand. In many ways the American breakfast category is like the British pub sector. It will not be business as usual and those who do not adapt quickly to changing consumer dining behaviors and emerging trends will disappear.</p>
<p>The way it is shaping up reminds me of the story of the frog who stayed in the pot until he boiled because he couldn’t tell it was getting hotter little bit by little bit. If a frog is dropped in scolding water he’d jump right back out. Similarly, if the CEOs in this industry segment were to be dropped into this pot they’d immediately take corrective action. Since these beleaguered chains are just lumbering about and evolving slower than dining behaviors and marketing approaches are evolving, they don’t see they are about to boil to death in the pot in which they sit. They need to move a heck of a lot quicker than they are to catch up with where the industry and consumer behaviors are headed.</p>
<h2>Ruby Tuesday’s</h2>
<p><img style="float: right; width: 250px;" title="Ruby Tuesday's" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/ruby-tuesdays.jpg" alt="how to market a restaurant - Ruby Tuesday's" width="200" />One of the marketing minds and CEOs I most admire in this industry is Brad Blum. He was the turnaround guy for Darden’s Olive Garden. So successful there he eventually elevated up the ranks to become vice chairman of the chain and heir apparent for the CEO post there. He left for Burger King’s revolving door CEO post and went in with exactly the right strategy for them – focus on flame-broiled and a few core signature items. The franchisees revolted (as usual). Eventually, he (and my point in all this) arrived at beleaguered Ruby Tuesday. His turnaround strategy was to focus on the inside out as he had done with Olive Garden and attempted with Burger King. He worked up those popular signature items that one could argue set off a new gold rush for gourmet burger concepts. His program and approach in the turnarounds of both Olive Garden and the partial resuscitation of Ruby Tuesday’s are both terrific case studies for the strategy of reviving brands by focusing on the inside and working outward (new signature menu items, then interior design, then exterior communication <em>versus</em> new exteriors, then interiors, then menus and training).</p>
<p><img title="Barton G" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/barton-g.jpg" alt="how to market a restaurant - Barton G" width="300" /></p>
<h2>Barton G</h2>
<p>If you’re looking for inspiration on incredible plate presentation approaches then Barton G in Miami has to be on your hit-list. Each dish is plated in the same way art is framed. The plating and presentation of the food enhances and amplifies the experience of the dish in much the same way the frame is selected for the painting rather than the painting being created to match the frame. Now what they do there is over the top and not something a large-scale chain could match or one-up, but the inspiration is there nonetheless. You can’t go to Barton G and not want to re-plate each item on your menu so that the garnish and presentation helps tell a story (rather than that dated old approach of a piece of kale or parsley and couple lemons as the garnish). They bring out a blender for shakes; stuff sparklers in cotton candy; and have plates that are used with only one intended dish. The tuna for example comes out on an elevated platform and sits atop a bead of wheatgrass and has a little Buddha statue on it. Again, this isn’t mass-market kind of stuff, but it is so “signature” that it makes Barton G one of those must-see places for any foodie (and pulls in revenue rumored to be in excess of $30m for the restaurant and their catering operations – which is HUGE!).</p>
<p><img title="Cayman Curse" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/cayman-curse.jpg" alt="Signature Items - Cayman Curse" width="300" /></p>
<h2>Cayman Curse</h2>
<p>When I took over operations for a $4 million Caribbean-themed restaurant, I focused in on the bar. We generated nearly 30% of revenues from the bar and were running bar costs in the high 20’s (cost as a percentage of sales). When I studied our purchasing and inventory, I saw that we had stacked up cases and cases of a product that wasn’t moving. Canadian Club had been running a promotion for their new Canadian Club Citrus and so they were giving bottles of it away with purchases of other faster-moving product. Our competitors up and down the beach had amassed mountains of this product too. They started trying to unload it with $2 shots. Then $1. Then 50 cents. No one bought it. People had never heard of Canadian Club Citrus and they figured that if it was selling for 50 cents it couldn’t be good.</p>
<p>So, I took a different approach. I invented a drink called the “Cayman Curse” and said we couldn’t tell you what goes in it or you will get the curse of the Cayman’s. The recipe called for citrus juices which picked up on the citrus notes in Canadian Club Citrus and masked the Whisky taste. We sold them for $8 and built appeal by putting dry ice in (which makes the drink appear to “smoke”) and supported it with a suggestive selling program. Results? This “mystery drink” made from a previously un-moveable liquor became our top seller. We started trading a bottle of Crown Royal with other restaurants for a case at a time of the product they weren’t moving. Our cost in mixing the drink was so low that – coupled with the huge volume – it brought our overall bar costs down to 16% of revenue. That’s half of what it was! Just one innovative idea and new approach to inventory utilization made a big impact on the bottom line. You don’t have to have a bar though – similar approaches can be taken with different varieties of fish, for example, and you’re not only reducing costs but also taking pressure off other fish species.</p>
<p><img title="Patagonian Toothfish" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/patagonian-toothfish.jpg" alt="Signature Items - Patagonian Toothfish" width="300" /></p>
<h2>Patagonian Toothfish</h2>
<p>Necessity is the mother of invention. The Chilean aquaculture industry had a wonderfully tasting fish that few foodies knew of or wanted. The Patagonian Toothfish. Ever see that on a menu? Probably not. Just the name conjures images of a grotesque (uh, image here is not accurate, but what we were probably all envisioning). The Chilean Toothfish and Chilean Sea Bass are the exact same fish. The only difference is marketing. Sometimes a signature item can be discovered by taking something wonderful and undiscovered and presenting it in a more appealing manner. Other examples here are Buffalo Chicken Wings and Flank Steak. Both were once considered undesirable, un-marketable and were incredibly cheap.</p>
<p>When one bar in Buffalo found a use for the chicken wing, he made a killing. No, unfortunately for him he’s not getting a royalty on every wing sold in the world, but when he first started he was buying them super-cheap and doing incredible volume by coming up with something “new” and signature. Now chicken wings – once discarded – cost more than breast meat due to the high demand for them. Likewise, Flank Steak is now outselling Filet Mignon in some high-end eateries. There are plenty more similar opportunities waiting to be discovered by those foodservice marketers looking for them. What the Patagonian Toothfish can teach or remind us about marketing is that perception is reality. If a name or connotation conjures something unappealing or different than what you actually intend it to, it is wise to create a new name (whether that’s a fish species, or a menu item, or a category (like the British “pubs”), or even a brand/company name.</p>
<h2>Other Examples</h2>
<ol>
<li>Discretional Chef: A number of restaurant chains give their chef discretion to purchase what’s freshest and make that the focus of the menu. It’s a signature approach.</li>
<li>Joes Stone Crab: With sales exceeding $22m in just six months, Joe’s Stone Crab in Miami takes a delicacy that any competitor can also purchase, and puts their signature on it by selling by classification and size of the stone crab such as their “jumbo” and “selects”.</li>
<li>Lava Cake: Fleming’s Steakhouse recommends their signature dessert while they’re taking the entrée order. Rather than wait too late after guests are full, they explain that their signature Lava Cake takes 45 minutes to prepare and ask “shall I put one in for you with your dinner order so there’s no need to wait?” Nice upsell! Works all the time.</li>
<li>Chef’s Table &amp; Tastings: Upscale restaurants are finding great success with limited seating chef’s tables and tastings. The kitchen table at Charlie Trotters in Chicago is sold out many months in advance.</li>
<li>In &amp; Out Burger’s Secret Menu Codes: With a cult-like following, California-based In &amp; Out Burger is widely known for what’s not widely known – secret codes for ordering menu items not on the menu. It’s part of their signature.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Trends to Consider</h2>
<p>We’re tracking too many global foodservice industry trends to cover here but a few of them that are top of mind as it relates to brainstorming <strong>signature items</strong> include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Small Plates and Sharing: The days of big plates with overwhelming portions; head-sized desserts that cost more than appetizers; and entrée-only menu programming are out (at least here in the US market – we’re watching how many international markets pursue American restaurant approaches/trends but lag 4-7 years behind what’s hot here so this approach is still working abroad). What’s working better now is small and sharable. Rather than gorge on one redundant flavor, they want to have lots of different tastes.</li>
<li>Unique Source: Where you get your product will become increasingly important to consumers. This is really heating up.</li>
<li>Slow and Local: New debates and pending legislation surround what can really be called “local”. Consumers want local though. It’s a hot buzzword and emerging movement.</li>
<li>Bold Flavors: As Boomers taste buds fade, it takes more kick to rouse their senses. Bold flavors are in.</li>
<li>Less Fuss: Consumers want the flavors of the ingredients to shine through, not have their food covered in thick sauces and seasonings. Simplicity in preparation is more desired than a dish where the chef was overbearing on the food and bent it to serve his will.</li>
<li>Authenticity: Fake and “faux” are out. Consumers today want “the real thing”. They want “genuine” and “transparent” and trustworthy authenticity.</li>
<li>Old Favorites: We’re seeing a successful resurgence of old classics coming back on to menus such as steak tartar, chicken and waffles, stuffed burgers and more. Just as with fashion, some popular periods circle back and become hot again.</li>
<li>Auctions: Groupon, eBay, Living Social, Home Shopping Network, and more have elevated the “auction” and “limited quantity” appeal/craze to a national and international level of awareness and participation. The “get it while it lasts” marketing approach has been around for a long time but the new popularity is now influencing the restaurant industry. Rather than sell your brand on a discount with something like Groupon’s notion of an auction, maybe you could try a limited-time sell-out dish to pre-order? That’s a new way to get in on the craze.</li>
<li>Superfruits and Nutrition: The consumer consciousness regarding what goes in their body has been steadily on the rise. Many are starting to remember the old adage, “You are what you eat”, and are paying closer attention to the nutritional value of their food. Some early adopters are taking this further with a “food as medicine” interpretation. Food packed with nutrition is a trend that can’t be ignored.</li>
<li>Sense of Place: Why would I want to go to Malaysia and eat Buffalo Chicken Wings instead of Malay Chicken Satay? Or Seattle and eat a steak instead of seafood? Increasingly, consumers want food that gives them a sense of place.</li>
<li>Kitchen to the Bar: Bars that operate more like kitchens – such as chef-driven signature drinks concocted in collaboration with a mixologist – are gaining appeal. More examples on this to come in the future.</li>
</ol>
<h2>A Few More Signature Item Tips and Benefits</h2>
<ol>
<li>Focus– It can’t all be special. Signature items force the organization to focus on being exceptional on core strengths and messages.</li>
<li>Make it Easy– We all have too many demands on us. By the time dinner guests make it into the restaurant they have already made hundreds if not thousands of decisions. Signature items make it easy to decide. Making it easy for the consumer is appreciated and you’re rewarded with the higher gross margin often engineered into signature items.</li>
<li>Reflect Brand– The best signature item you can have is one that reflects your own distinct brand positioning, personality, promise, and story.</li>
<li>Use Menu Engineering as Foundation– With the brand platform clearly articulated, the next step is to consider emerging trends and also existing performance through the menu engineering analysis.</li>
<li>Outside Help– Sure, it may sound self-serving of a restaurant consultant to say, but it is nevertheless true that hiring outside help is a short-cut to identifying that break-through signature item. Even the McDonald’s brothers didn’t know what they had until Ray Kroc got involved and saw the potential and opportunities only a fresh eye can spot.</li>

<h2>Chapter 7: Improving Staff Morale</h2>
<p>The industry has had a couple of rough years in a row now. We’re finding that some spirits are sagging; especially for those segments of the industry hardest hit. It’s important to focus on improving staff morale during these tough times.</p>
</header>
<p>In beleaguered chains, the impact on morale runs top to bottom and both managers and their staff are feeling weathered from the sustained pressures and stress. There is no doubt that a restaurant enterprise – and its financial performance – is the sum of its people. Therefore, we are dedicating Part Seven of our ten-part Boosting Restaurant Revenue series to the importance of a talented and inspired workforce. More specifically, we’re focusing on some of the “how-to” for reinvigorating an existing workforce that may be worn down from years of a struggling economy and uncertainty.</p>
<p>For Part Seven we turn to one of the best in the industry on the subject of training and improving multi-unit performance and profitability by improving people – Jim Sullivan.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="JS Twit Pic" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/JS-Twit-Pic.jpg" alt="how to market a restaurant - Improving Staff Morale - Jim Sullivan" width="227" height="240" /></p>
<p>For those who don’t already know him, Jim has long been one of the industry’s top-drawing speakers and a sought-after consultant. His books have sold more than 650,000 copies worldwide and his client list reads like an industry who’s-who, including companies like Starbucks, Coca-Cola, Walt Disney Company, American Express, McDonald’s, Panera Bread and Apple. I’ve long held Jim in high regard and am excited to share with you some of his thoughts on this important subject.</p>
<p>Following are my questions and Jim’s advice on the subject of reinvigorating staff morale as a means of boosting restaurant revenue:</p>
<h2>1. What’s your assessment of the general state of the industry for staff morale? Of course, it varies by organization and isn’t a one-size-fits-all, but based on your wide industry exposure are there any universal observations you can share about where we stand today?</h2>
<p>Industry-wide, morale is not as good as it was yesterday but it can be a whole lot better tomorrow. If executive teams/ operators would stay committed to hiring “A” players for their hourly crews that would be a huge start. Then they’d have to make certain their management team was sharp and talented. Stars don’t work for idiots.</p>
<h2>2. How can operators assess their own situation and quantify the esprit de corps?</h2>
<p>By being able to answer “yes” to the Big 3 questions: Are you meeting and exceeding your goals? Is customer traffic up from last year? Is team turnover less than 20%?</p>
<h2>3. What are the hidden costs of uninspired employees and low staff morale? Can you help put a business case on the importance of reinvigorating the workforce as a means of also helping boost revenues?</h2>
<p>“Labor” is not your biggest controllable cost, turnover is. Reinvigorate a workforce three ways: 1) hire and develop outstanding managers who have a knack for inspiration, discipline and accountability, 2) prune the deadwood, 3) teach everyone something new every shift.</p>
<h2>4. What guidance would you offer an operator endeavoring to build a merit-based reward and recognition system – not just for the line-level staff but for all levels of the organization?</h2>
<p>In my experience, “carrots” don’t work. They reinforce only the employees who are already the most engaged and productive in your restaurant or store. Plus most operators create programs that reward individual accomplishment while they preach the importance of teamwork. You’re better off creating a stronger culture in which low performance is simply not an option. To paraphrase Paul Marciano: “Recognition and reward programs fail because they are programs.” These programs rarely lead to long-term sustainable behavioral change because they don’t impact organizational culture. Reward programs are little more than camouflage for ineffective management. If you want to truly motivate your performers to do better, hold those who are not doing their job accountable. Do you want to know what “Quality” is? Conformance to requirements.</p>
<h2>5. How do you align shift-minded staff with long-range company goals?</h2>
<p>You hire only people with an affinity for learning. Then you teach them something new each and every shift. Then you share your company’s progress and goals every quarter with a State-of-the-Restaurant address to the team.</p>
<h2>6. How do you recommend sorting out who to keep, who terminate, and who to promote?</h2>
<p>Restaurateurs who complain about the quality if their teams are like someone who’s sitting on a stove and complaining that their ass is burning. Do something about it. Give a lot, expect a lot, and if you don’t get it, prune.</p>
<h2>7. How are new technologies and the rise of Millennials changing industry training and people-development in your opinion?</h2>
<p>Technology has already transformed ordering, scheduling, back-office systems, and marketing. The biggest impact area of opportunity now is in training. We need to align the way we train to how Millennials live and interact online. Gen Next prefers to create content instead of just consuming it. So training needs to become more collaborative and leverage technology better. Many of our hourly team members – because of technology and the supercomputer in their phones – can, in fact, be better informed or have access to better information than the trainer does. Foodservice trainers today have to get caught up to their trainees technology-wise and mindset-wise. This is very different from the past where trainees had to get caught up to their trainers. The Internet teaches us to avoid the margin-to-margin text of the “training manual” and educate instead via info-nuggets, chunked information and just-on-time training that iPod Generation learners can easily digest and even improve upon by contributing their own experience to the content. I watch how industries awash in cash– like insurance companies, healthcare and hedge funds–train their young people because they can afford to pioneer methodologies that will soon be commonplace for food service companies.</p>
<h2>8. What are the emerging trends and some of your predictions for executives to consider as they build their workforce development plans for the future?</h2>
<p>Spend more time scaling successes than you do solving problems. Identify pockets of exceptional performance throughout your company and think about ways you can duplicate that success. Make tacit knowledge explicit across your organization. Don’t benchmark other great companies until you benchmark your own.</p>
<h2>9. Are there any new tools, companies or websites you have found lately that you think the industry should know about?</h2>
<p>I am impressed with the growing groundswell of support and participation that Twitter is seeing among foodservice operators. I am there daily (@Sullivision) to contribute and gain insight into articles, blogs, and websites that I never would have learned about without Tweets. Beyond that, at the risk of sounding self-serving, I’d suggest your readers check out my blogs, articles, and videos at my website where we regularly detail fun and effective new sites and tools that help foodservice operators improve their people, performance and profits.</p>
<h2>10. I understand you have a new book coming out. What can you tell us about it and where our readers go to buy it?</h2>
<p>It’s called <i>Fundamentals: 9 Ways to Be Brilliant at the New Basics of Business.</i> It covers business basics for the Digital Age leader and reader in a fun design. It’s chockablock-full of great content, ideas, expertise and insight. Fundamentals will be available on the Sullivision.com website in late August and at Amazon and bookstores in September. Read it and reap!</p>
<h2>11. You write extensively about leadership and your products are all about developing leaders. What are the three key things that great leaders do?</h2>
<p>They take control of what controls their time, they focus on being effective not efficient, and they regularly read industry and non-industry business books, blogs and interviews of thought leaders. Not all readers are leaders, but all leaders are readers.<a name="8"></a></p>

<h2>Chapter 8: New Things to Buzz About</h2>
</header>
<p>Something has gone wrong at one of my old favorite restaurants. I decided to make my notes for this part in the boosting restaurant revenue series from a table at one of my old favorite restaurants in Orlando – Luma on Park. Five years ago, Luma was the hottest new restaurant in Central Florida. It was a first date kind of place. We entertained some of our best clients here, and for a while I was spending a significant pile of cash here every week, without an end in sight. This was a great restaurant, with an adventurous menu of contemporary American fare, and creating massive buzz throughout Orlando and Central Florida – but judging by my latest visit, Luma has fallen from grace.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="Luma Interior" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Luma-Inside-279x300.png" alt="how to market a restaurant - Luma on Park" width="223" height="240" /></p>
<p>When this restaurant first opened, you needed a crowbar to get in and could expect a two-hour wait before being seated in the dining room. Tonight it was very different. There was no wait for a table, and the dining room was far from packed. Sure, it was a weekday, but you could feel that ghost-of-restaurants-past lurking in the lonely shadows. My previous visits to Luma felt exhilarating, but tonight it felt eerie.</p>
<p>What went wrong? How can Luma get back to the level its fans have come to expect? And what lessons are there for the rest of us?</p>
<h2>Luma’s History</h2>
<p>Luma burst onto the Orlando restaurant scene with great fanfare. Owned by Brian France, the CEO of NASCAR, Luma had deep-pocketed ownership that was willing to invest in creating a one-of-a-kind experience. Housed in a former bank building, the owners reportedly poured in $5 million to convert the prime corner location on Park Avenue into a restaurant.</p>
<p>This kind of math simply doesn’t work for mere mortal restaurateurs. When you have deep pockets and your first priority is delivering a spectacular experience (even before the imperative of profit), you tend to think about the restaurant business differently than a start-up mom and pop (or those evil, “profit only” chain empires). I watched the launch and progress of Luma with great interest, as I’m always particularly interested in restaurateurs who think about experience first, profits second (whether they have big budgets or not).</p>
<p>I happened to have a meeting with one of France’s top executives who told me that while some wealthy people collect cars, or planes, or mansions, Brian France’s muse is the restaurant business. This passion and level of cultivated personal interest were apparent in every aspect of Luma’s atmosphere. Luma was a pretty spectacular new addition in the local market. Truly they had a hit on their hands.</p>
<p>Five years later, the place is a shadow of its former self.</p>
<h2>What Happened?</h2>
<p>While it’s hard for me to diagnose what went wrong based on a single visit, I would venture to guess that Luma has been coasting on its previous success.</p>
<p>Too many restaurants fall into this trap: they start out with a big launch, big buzz, and critical acclaim, but then they fail to follow up with something new to buzz about. Eventually, the initial buzz fades, and so does the restaurant.</p>
<p>Even the best, most acclaimed restaurants need to constantly innovate.</p>
<h2>Constant Innovation is an Essential</h2>
<p>A year or two after Luma opened, one of Brian France’s top executives stopped in to visit us at our office. He was looking for some fresh new ideas, industry insights, and PR strategies for Luma. Maybe this sounds odd – after all, the restaurant was doing blockbuster business, everyone loved it. “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it,” right?</p>
<p>Wrong. Even though we didn’t end up working together, France’s executive was doing exactly the right thing by seeking out new ideas for Luma. Barely weeks after Luma’s honeymoon period, this guy was on the hunt for fresh ideas to keep Orlando’s hottest restaurant the hottest. (This is what a good “number two” does, by the way – they think about what number one needs before number one thinks about it.)</p>
<h2>Keep Pushing</h2>
<p>Investing in new things to buzz about might seem unnecessary; isn’t it better to maintain momentum and profit off the restaurant’s existing direction? Rather than staying the course, the smartest investment is to keep ahead of the curve. Some restaurant executives prefer to simply ride out the profits gained from coasting after an initial push; it costs less to coast than to keep your foot on the accelerator. Others recognize that if you take your foot off the accelerator, you may coast pretty well for a while, but if you wait too long you’ll dramatically lose speed, and you’ll end up needing to spend a lot more energy to get back that lost momentum and recapture your market positioning.</p>
<p>How can your restaurants avoid the trap of early success?</p>
<h2>Give Your Customers NEW Things to Buzz About Before It’s Too Late</h2>
<p>In the corporate world, we tend to plan months, years or decades ahead. Restaurant customers tend to plan just days or hours ahead. Restaurant customers want to know what’s hot <em>TONIGHT</em> – not, what are some guys thinking that they may or may not do a few months from now.</p>
<p>Executives often think about what’s going to be relevant to the quarterly balance sheet or annual stockholders meeting. Customers think about what’s worth talking about, what’s new to experience, what’s exciting and worth my hard-earned money for tonight. Today’s restaurant customer asks, “What’s worth Tweeting about?” That’s how much the attention div has changed.</p>
<h2>Renovate or Reinvent Before You Have To</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="Madonna Innovation" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Madonna-300x250.png" alt="Boosting Restaurant Revenue - Madonna Keeps Reinventing Herself" width="300" height="250" /></p>
<p>Madonna has reinvented herself so many times it was the title of one of her world tours (I didn’t go; <a title="Re-Invention World Tour, Madonna" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Re-Invention_World_Tour" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia tells me</a> that was the title of the 2004 tour). She has remained a relevant hit-maker for decades now by consistently giving her fans a new dimension to be awed by, her critics something to talk about, and her potential fans a new reason to consider buying in. While Madonna’s clothes, hairstyles, and collaborators have changed through the years, the core of her brand has remained constant. In other words, if she were a restaurant, she hasn’t changed her “brand personality,” “brand positioning strategy,” her “brand promise,” or her “brand story.” She has evolved, ‘renovated’, and reinvented a dozen or more times while still remaining true to the core brand attributes that put her on top.</p>
<p>The same goes for any celebrity or brand that has enjoyed longevity – to have staying power you have to constantly look to one-up yourself. You have to constantly give your fans and critics something new to talk about.</p>
<h2>Innovators, Early Adopters and The Tipping Point</h2>
<p>The iPhone is the fastest-selling product in history and Apple is now the highest valued technology company in the world as a result. How they got there was not with discounting but with innovating. Consistently, under Steve Jobs’ leadership, the company has believed in the impossible and continuously strived to <strong>out-do themselves.</strong> That is a key distinction – Apple sees its biggest competitor as not some other force “outside” the company, but the company’s own past performance. Apple wasn’t looking to one-up the competition or win customers by offering a lower price for something that people were already buying. Rather than look for a bigger piece of an existing market, Apple created entirely new markets by dreaming up how to solve a problem and deliver a product that customers weren’t even aware of yet – but that they soon couldn’t live without.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="Tipping Point" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Tipping-Point-216x300.png" alt="Boosting Restaurant Revenue - The Tipping Point" width="216" height="300" /></p>
<p>Apple used to be kind of a “niche” company for early adopters and enthusiasts of a certain type of personal computer. Apple was for true believers, while IBM and Microsoft products were mainstream. However, in the past 10 years, Apple has become a mainstream company – not by appealing to more mainstream people, but by transmitting their marketing efforts through their true believers and biggest fans.</p>
<p>To go mainstream and enjoy wide market penetration you have to first win over the “Innovators” and the “Early Adopters” and give them something to buzz about that reflects how they see themselves. Innovators and Early Adopters don’t buy Apple products because of the great features and functions; they ultimately buy Apple products because they believe in Apple’s mission of challenging the status quo, and they see themselves reflected in that mission. As Seth Godin puts it – “<em>A reason to bring it back to the hive.</em>”</p>
<p>Now, most of you have heard this message a few times before and get it. However, what we need to remember is that this innovation cycle isn’t just for startups. Mature or established brands have to repeat the cycle again and again; offering the Innovators and Early Adopters a stream of new reasons to bring your brand back to their hive in perpetuity. Flowers keep offering up their nectar to the bees, giving the bees a reason to come back each day, pick up their pollen, and pollinate the entire garden while bringing back something to sustain the bee colony living in the hive. In this analogy, your brand is the flower and your consistent stream of innovations are your nectar, giving the bees (or customers) a reason to keep coming back again and again.</p>
<p>“<em>If you don’t like change, you’re going to like irrelevance even less</em>.” – General Eric Shinseki</p>
<h2>This Video is Worth All 17 Minutes</h2>
<p>Seth Godin argues that the era of mass production (Henry Ford and the assembly line) and mass marketing (pushing ideas out to try to “hypnotize” audiences with TV ads, etc.) is at an end. Instead, the new model of marketing is very old: tribes. Your restaurant needs to cultivate a sense of mission to inspire passion and devotion by a community of devoted fans who will go out of their way to connect with you and support your business.</p>
<p>If I gave people what they wanted it would have been faster horses.” – Henry Ford</p>
<p>Starbucks would have never been born of a focus group.</p>
<p>If there is already a case study to show it’s a good idea you’re probably too late.</p>
<p>Surround yourself with people who are comfortable being uncomfortable, who believe in the impossible, who fan the flames of your creative passions. The business world already has enough creative suppression systems in place – there is already an “abundance of caution” in business. It’s often more likely that you are costing your company more by playing it safe than by having the courage to take calculated risks.</p>
<p>Richard Branson didn’t even finish high school and admittedly still doesn’t know the difference between net profit and gross profit, yet he has built one of the most admired multi-billion dollar corporations on Earth. When he thought of going from music stores to airlines to taking his brand literally into orbit (with <a href="http://www.virgingalactic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Virgin Galactic</a>) he didn’t go to the world’s best spaceship designer; he went to the most creative designer he could think of: Philippe Starck.</p>
<p>Neither Starck nor Branson had ever designed a space shuttle before but that didn’t stop them. In fact, their unfamiliarity with the status quo is what propelled them. Sure, they surrounded themselves with lots of technical folks, financiers, and “grown-ups,” but the two creative forces led the project. The technical folks will help make sure the ship doesn’t blow up, but the technical folks would have never taken the leap or conceived the same project.</p>
<p>Richard Branson has built a multibillion-dollar business empire by doing things that other people told him were “crazy.” He believes that life is a relentless process of learning and “turning the status quo upside down.” In <a title="Richard Branson TED Talk" href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/richard_branson_s_life_at_30_000_feet.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this TED talk</a>, Richard Branson discusses some of his most famous and boldest business decisions, like the time he decided to sell Virgin Records for an all-in bet on saving Virgin Atlantic airlines. His business advisors told him it was crazy, but it proved to be the best decision he could have possibly made.</p>
<p><img title="Albert Einstein" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Albert-Einstein-205x300.png" alt="Boosting Restaurant Revenue - Albert Einstein and Innovation" width="300" /></p>
<p>Albert Einstein, when asked what was the most important breakthrough in helping him develop his Theory of Relativity, responded: “Thinking about how to think about the problem.” There are a number of great Einstein quotes that are relevant here.</p>
<p><em>“Imagination is more important than knowledge.”</em></p>
<p><em>“The only real valuable thing is intuition.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Great spirits have often encountered violent opposition from weak minds.”</em></p>
<p><em>“We can’t solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Famous ad for Apple: Think Different. “The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.”</strong></p>
<p>If that way of thinking was what helped Einstein pioneer groundbreaking scientific discoveries that fundamentally changed human understanding of how the universe works, surely it’s good enough to help our industry figure out how to put a few more butts in seats. He had 24 hours in the day just like all of us. He told us his secret. Heck, so has almost every great achiever or brand pioneer. It was to zig when the competition zagged. It was to follow their intuition more than a case study or feasibility study.</p>
<p>Captain Kirk says it: <em>to boldly go where no man has gone before.</em></p>
<p>Joseph Campbell: <em>Follow your bliss.</em></p>
<p>Jack Welch: <em>You have to be on the lunatic fringe.</em></p>
<p>Seth Godin: <em>Be remarkable.</em></p>

<h2>Chapter 9: Being Remarkable</h2>
</header>
<p>Being remarkable should be the centerpiece for your vision when you are planning how to market a restaurant. Good food, good service, and good atmosphere are NOT being remarkable. <a href="https://www.shankman.com/the-greatest-customer-service-story-ever-told-starring-mortons-steakhouse/">A restaurant sending a steak to the airport</a> for one of your most vocal fans is being remarkable.</p>
<p>That Shankman story has been sent to me a half-dozen times by now. It’s the very definition of WOW. Who wouldn’t feel like telling everyone if they had that kind of experience?</p>
<p>Already the naysayers are exclaiming and dismissing such a thought as impractical, not business-minded, “giving away the farm.” “We can’t afford to do this for our customers! It costs too much money. Better to just keep our heads down, keep buying billboard space and running ads in the phone book…”</p>
<p>When this type of objection used to come up with clients in the past, I would expend the energy, lay out the case, expand the logic and proffer more “realistic” ideas for them to baby-step their way into this more innovative way of thinking. Finally, I realized after much pain and anguish that you can’t baby-step your way to being remarkable. The people who don’t get it are never really fully going to get it, and fighting with them only distracts you from the really important work of finding the people who believe in “remarkable,” and becoming remarkable.</p>
<p>As Seth Godin explains so clearly in Tribes, your followers want to you to lead them. Your followers are the people who believe in your brand: your customers and your employees. And you have many other prospective followers among the silent masses who share your beliefs and are interested in your mission, but have not yet been introduced to your brand. They will be pleased to meet you and to have you lead them.</p>
<p>At the risk of using too many quotes of great men who say it so much better than I could, I wanted to close with perhaps my favorite quote of all in the hopes that any restaurant industry executive or marketer looking for the courage to follow their own convictions – and pursue that big, hairy and risky idea or campaign – will find it in these words of Theodore Roosevelt:</p>
<p><em>“Far better it is to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs even though checkered by failure, than to rank with those poor spirits who neither enjoy nor suffer much because they live in the gray twilight that knows neither victory nor defeat.”</em></p>
<p>Be bold. Give your customers, employees, franchisees, investors, media, and community something new to talk about. Truly worth a “WOW!” Not a gimmick or following in the footsteps of some other company that did it first, but something that wows even yourself. Something that reflects the true convictions of your brand and your company’s reason for being. <strong>That gray twilight is the least safe place to be these days.</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>AFTERWORD: Just a few days after I wrote the first draft of this article about how to market a restaurant, Steve Jobs resigned as CEO of Apple. So I want to include just one last quote from Steve Jobs, the greatest innovator of our time, from his address to the 2005 graduating class of Stanford University: “Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.” Stay hungry: Innovators are hungry – they’re restless in pursuing change and challenging the status quo. Stay foolish: some of the best innovations are the “crazy” ones that people think are too unsafe, too risky, too out-there. Be foolish.</strong></em></p>
<p>DISCLOSURE</p>
<p>A sacred truth and conviction we hold is to keep all clients&#8217; (and prospective clients&#8217;) information confidential; in the strictest of confidence to be sure. While there may seem to be an air of familiarity with Luma mentioned in this post, it is derived from publicly disclosed information and personal consumer experience. No confidences were betrayed and several years have passed since we were asked – as many others were – to bid on the Luma business. We hold Luma, its management, and its officers in the very highest regards. The opinions tendered in this blog post are those based strictly on public and non-confidential information and are in no way intended to harm Luma or its stakeholders. To the contrary, we remain fans and cheerleaders for the company and generally hold Luma and the France family in the highest regard as they are among the most remarkable of entrepreneurial success stories in recent American history. We wish them and Luma much continued success. However, we also wish that they would rev up their engines and get Luma back on the right track. Central Florida needs Luma to regain its former glory; there are too few contemporary-oriented restaurants in Central Florida, and we need to keep the ones we’ve got. Like a Ferrari, Lear jet, or beautiful mansion; a great restaurant must be maintained. High-performance vehicles take more care and attention to operate than a beat-up Buick. The same goes for high-performance restaurants. Luma is flaming in its need for attention.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10: Know the Trends</h2>
</header>
<p>A trends list may not seem as tangible and actionable as a list of promotional tactics for how to market a restaurant, but if a restaurant chain is looking to leapfrog over their competitors they need to know the trends. They will need to be able to correctly predicting where the market is going and get there before the consumer or your competitor even knew it was where they wanted to be.</p>
<p>We all know the pace of change is accelerating. And never before has it been more evident that success today favors those companies who innovate. As you scan the restaurant industry for recent success stories you see that the most profitable and fastest-growing concepts are those who are innovating in fast-growing categories and are perceived to be originals. That means not only knowing the restaurant trends, but also creating them.</p>
<p>Ideally, the best positioning you can have is to be the “original.” The second best positioning you can have is to be the “alternative.” In many instances, you can add the market share of #1 and #2 in any category and you’ll find their share is greater than that of #3 through #10 combined. An often-used example to look at is Coke versus Pepsi. Coke is “The Real Thing” (the original) and Pepsi is “The Choice of a New Generation” (the alternative). Any idea who’s #3 in cola? Few do. To be the original, you have to be first (or really early to the party and boldly claim leadership). You can’t be first following the trends. As Henry Ford famously said, “If we’d given people what they wanted it would have been faster horses.” Don’t aim for where the target is at; shoot for where the target will be.</p>
<h2>Four Reasons You Need to Know the Trends</h2>
<p>There are numerous benefits to being ahead of the trends. Some of them include:</p>
<h2>1. Profitability</h2>
<p>When you know the trends you benefit considerably. Consumers reward companies that innovate by happily agreeing to pay premium prices. This means higher margins. Innovative companies who know the trends are more profitable than those who ignorantly try to build their business on the quicksand of discounting.</p>
<h2>2. Newsworthiness</h2>
<p>Journalists know the trends and seek early-adopters to interview and cite in stories about new technologies, trends, and innovations. Just look at Kogi Korean BBQ. When Twitter was just starting to catch on in 2009, journalists were looking for small business success stories of using Twitter for marketing. Naturally, reporters look to the restaurant industry for small business examples. Few mega chain restaurants were early adopters of Twitter and so Kogi started fielding the calls. The story caught on and snowballed (once one news organization covers a story others follow suit and this can create a positive media feeding frenzy). The coverage got so hot that it actually helped spawn a whole new trend and industry category – Food Trucks. What started out as a story about an early adopter of a new trend helped actually create a billion dollar category. By 2011, Food Trucks were listed by the National Restaurant Association as one of the top 10 industry trends for the year. In short, when you are on top of the trends, you get noticed not just by customers and talented professionals who want to join your team, you also get noticed by journalists, investors, partners and more. And, you may springboard even further and create a whole new category that you own and are forever credited with fathering.</p>
<h2>3. Beacon of Success</h2>
<p>Every one wants to be associated with success. By innovating, you build not only on the results of success but also the perception of success. The success pheromones will attract the brightest people who want to work with you, reporters who want to write about your company, investors and franchisees who want to join with you, and other partners who seem to come out of the woodwork. For instance, we had a client who had tried unsuccessfully for a decade to get an A location in Las Vegas, but after we helped secure a feature story about the client in Forbes, the A locations started courting our client.</p>
<h2>4. Market Share</h2>
<p>Apple has always made it a priority to know the trends. You can see this with their product development. RIM’s Blackberry has been decimated by Apple’s iPhone. Blackberry – once referred to as the “Crackberry” because it was checked so much in boardroom meetings – is so crippled that it may actually go under, and meanwhile Apple owns nearly 50% of the smartphone market. My, what an astonishing turn of events in just a few short years. It all boils down to this: one company was slow to innovate and sat confidently on its laurels while another company was aiming not just to know the trends, but put together the clues found in the trends and build its entire corporate strategy on a vision of the future. The moral of the story is that even if you are know the trends today and gleefully enjoying that success, you have to continuously look and plan ahead to keep that position. I know you know this already. It’s how you got to where you are today. I’m simply offering a humble reminder – innovation is as important as ever before, change is accelerating faster than ever before, and your commitment know the trends has to be commensurately prioritized.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With consumer appetites always evolving, restaurants are making changes to their marketing efforts. Traditional advertising is still important, but the use of digital, social, and mobile have been increasing for years. And then there&#8217;s the increased competition, which is dramatically altering the restaurant landscape and, by extension, the way chains market their products. No longer is McDonald&#8217;s hoping to steal share only from its direct rivals, such as Burger King or Wendy&#8217;s. Today, the Golden Arches is hoping that it can woo consumers away from snacking, Starbucks, and fast-casual chains (among many other <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-startup-funding" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new competitors</a>).</p>
<p>As a growing number of consumers go online to shop for (and pay for) everything from clothing to groceries, restaurant chains are attempting to figure out where they fit in the e-commerce puzzle. As a result, we&#8217;ve seen online traffic increase. A recent report shows that web traffic to chains in the snack category grew 28% in 2015, led largely by Starbucks, which saw engagement grow 40% the same year. So it&#8217;s no wonder that quick-service restaurants are upping their advertising spend (16% in the first two months of 2017) — with so much competition, the noise has never been louder, and efforts to break through never more challenging.</p>
<p>Here, we highlight some compelling global restaurant marketing examples, along with a slew of facts and figures about the value of marketing.</p>
<h2>DIGITAL IS THE MARKETING ORDER OF THE DAY</h2>
<p>Digital marketing spend is up, expected to pace at an 11% compound annual growth rate between now and 2021. Still, the way restaurants are utilizing digital is vast and varied, particularly when it comes to chains with locations throughout the globe.</p>
<p>In India, where the fast-food market today is only one-tenth the size of China&#8217;s, there&#8217;s still plenty of opportunity — and international operators have caught on. The region&#8217;s fast-food industry doubled in size between 2013 and 2016, due in large part to major players that have steadily caught on to the needs and demands of Indian consumers. One such chain is KFC which, in 2013, introduced the WOW@25 app, which used augmented reality, gamification, and 3D animation to scan Indian currency, suggesting various options guests could enjoy based on their budgets. The app was incredibly well-received, skyrocketing to the top of the most-downloaded food and beverage applications in the country and garnering more than 35,000 downloads.</p>

<p>In the U.S., KFC has been heavily reliant on digital, too — particularly social media, where it recently hosted an online seminar for a live balloon launch of its fried chicken sandwich. The move was largely seen as a gimmick, but generated tremendous interest and received hundreds of thousands of views. Of course, international brands require special considerations — what works in one part of the world might not work in another. Such is the case in the UK and Ireland, where KFC has struggled a bit to refine its message and market its products effectively. The brand&#8217;s Chief Marketing Officer for the UK and Ireland recently told the local press that the chain was moving from messaging that could be perceived as “shouty” to ads that use wit and humor to grab attention (which resonate more with the region&#8217;s customer base).</p>
<h2>THOSE WHO INVEST IN TARGETED EFFORTS REAP THE GREATEST REWARDS</h2>
<p>Domino&#8217;s first edged past Pizza Hut in advertising spend in 2014, when it increased measured-media spending 16.9%. Today, it spends more on digital marketing than any other pizza chain — and the results are apparent.</p>
<div class="infogram-embed" data-id="dominos_advertising_spend_increasing_with_sales" data-type="interactive" data-title="Domino's Advertising Spend Increasing with Sales"></div>
<p><script>!function(e,t,s,i){var n="InfogramEmbeds",o=e.getElementsByTagName("script"),d=o[0],r=/^http:/.test(e.location)?"http:":"https:";if(/^\/{2}/.test(i)&&(i=r+i),window[n]&&window[n].initialized)window[n].process&&window[n].process();else if(!e.getElementById(s)){var a=e.createElement("script");a.async=1,a.id=s,a.src=i,d.parentNode.insertBefore(a,d)}}(document,0,"infogram-async","//e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js");</script></p>
<p>For every dollar spent on advertising over the last five years, Domino&#8217;s saw a roughly $35 return, with advertising spend increasing in almost constant relation to sales.</p>
<p>In addition to seeing sales spike in conjunction with increased marketing efforts, the pizza chain&#8217;s stock is up 5,557% since hitting its lowest point in 2008, and it now leads competitors in delivery. Most of the brand&#8217;s recent innovations have been in consumer experience and marketing (particularly through the use of tech) rather that in the product itself.</p>
<h2>STILL, TRADITIONAL EFFORTS REMAIN A BIG PART OF THE MARKETING MIX</h2>
<p>Though digital marketing has been taking its share of the headlines (and its share of many chains&#8217; advertising spend), many traditional marketing methods haven&#8217;t lost their effectiveness. Particularly <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/neighborhood-marketing-hotel-food-and-beverage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">neighborhood marketing</a>, which allows for tactics to be more personalized (and often dramatically less expensive) than other means.</p>
<p>The CMO of Canadian chain Tim Horton&#8217;s, for one, noted that though the chain has relied on social and digital marketing efforts in the past, its secret recipe has been the &#8220;market by market, neighborhood by neighborhood&#8221; work the brand has undertaken. The importance of neighborhood marketing efforts is key to the success of a number of brands, even giants like McDonald&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Just last month, after Saudi Arabian King Salman bin Abdulaziz al-Saud announced that he would appoint his son, Salman, as crown prince, McDonald&#8217;s KSA took out a full page ad in a local newspaper wishing the new prince “wisdom&#8230;peace and prosperity.”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9797" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-12-at-9.56.44-AM-e1499870406395.jpg" alt="McDonalds global restaurant marketing Saudi Arabia" width="481" height="864" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-12-at-9.56.44-AM-e1499870406395.jpg 481w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-12-at-9.56.44-AM-e1499870406395-350x629.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 481px) 100vw, 481px" /><br />
The move wasn&#8217;t all that unusual, especially considering McDonald’s KSA is owned by Mishaal Bin Khalid al Saud, a relative of Salman&#8217;s. Still, the ad propelled other regional fast food giants to follow suit, with both the Saudi franchises of Domino&#8217;s and Burger King tweeting their support for the new prince shortly after.</p>

Television plays an important role, too, with restaurants spending some 80% of dollars on TV as recently as 2014. As television changes (and Hulu and Netflix continue to take share from networks), even that will change. Last April, a UBS report noted that restaurants were among the advertisers to shift the greatest share of spend from TV to digital.</p>
<p>In recent years, though, TV advertisements have proved powerful, especially when used in conjunction with other forms of marketing. Tim Horton&#8217;s has seen success with one television ad in particular which was designed, according to the company, with social networking in mind. The hockey-themed ad was released in 2014, but still airs periodically — and, three years later, still elicits comments on social media.</p>

<h2>THE BEST MARKETING PORTFOLIOS ARE THOSE THAT ARE DIVERSE</h2>
<p>Multiple studies have proven the value of digital marketing, though it&#8217;s important to note that it varies depending on the brand and the product. Cadbury’s “Chocolate Charmer” online advertising campaign, for instance, provided an ROI almost four times higher than the corresponding TV campaign (after investing 7% of its budget online, the brand saw the sector generate 20% of sales). A Microsoft study of the effectiveness of digital advertising found that digital outperforms television, print, radio, and outdoor advertising and that, if digital is added to these media channels, it enhances their effectiveness. In other words, the most effective marketing budgets are those that blend all of the above, and ensure each piece works in conjunction.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to note the rapid changes when looking at just one subset of marketing: restaurant advertisements. Over the past decade, restaurant advertising spend has changed dramatically. Shares of that spend have changed through the years, too. Between 2005 and 2014, total ad spend grew 26%, but internet ad spend (as a category) grew 274%, an indication that it’s eating share from other categories.</p>
<div class="infogram-embed" data-id="dpz_ad_and_sales" data-type="interactive" data-title="Ad Spend by Medium"></div>
<p><script>!function(e,t,s,i){var n="InfogramEmbeds",o=e.getElementsByTagName("script"),d=o[0],r=/^http:/.test(e.location)?"http:":"https:";if(/^\/{2}/.test(i)&&(i=r+i),window[n]&&window[n].initialized)window[n].process&&window[n].process();else if(!e.getElementById(s)){var a=e.createElement("script");a.async=1,a.id=s,a.src=i,d.parentNode.insertBefore(a,d)}}(document,0,"infogram-async","//e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js");</script></p>
<p>Ad spend as a percent of revenue also varies according to restaurant segment. Quick-Service brands spend on average 2.8%, while Casual Dining chains spend 2.5%. However, CDR chain Red Lobster dedicates 7.1% of revenue to ad spend, higher than even the biggest-spending QSR chain (Papa Murphy’s, at 6.5%).</p>

<h2>WHAT&#8217;S IN STORE FOR GLOBAL RESTAURANT MARKETING</h2>
<p>In calculating a marketing project&#8217;s ROI, many chains measure the cost of launching the project and seeking to calculate the return on sales based on that investment. Increasingly, though, chains should start by thinking about what marketing objectives they aim to satisfy: why customers would visit the a website or social media page, or download an app; what behaviors they might engage in once there; and how that could all be linked to a chain&#8217;s overall objectives.</p>
<p>Decisions regarding which parts of the menu to support with marketing spend (drinks, desserts, entrées, etc.), when, and how best to do it will always be a crucial piece of the marketing equation. Digitization has led to a radical restructuring of traditional industry boundaries — and that will only increase over time. For restaurants, marketing with tomorrow&#8217;s landscape in mind means planning today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Human nature is a funny thing. It&#8217;s what propels people to fixate on earning points. As kids, we&#8217;re rewarded with gold stars — often completing our homework for the reward more than anything else. Not much changes as we grow older — though the gold stars are swapped with points, with people opting to be loyal to one airline, one hotel chain, or one restaurant simply to earn points (even if it means paying more). Enter restaurant loyalty programs, which have long been proven (like similar programs in the airline and hotel industry) to drive sales and create repeat customers.</p>
<p>For a restaurant, the goals of such a program are two-fold: While they offer guest incentives, restaurant loyalty programs also gather information about those guests in the process. The result is value not only for the guest, but for the chain itself. And yet, some of the largest foodservice chains in the world still aren&#8217;t on board with loyalty. McDonald&#8217;s is reportedly developing a loyalty program, though it hasn&#8217;t yet made any formal announcements. Whole Foods is also currently testing a program in select markets, though it isn&#8217;t yet widely available.</p>
<p>Those who&#8217;ve excelled have done so by ensuring their loyalty program offers something of value to both the company and its customers, and evolving to meet consumer demand. Savvy companies (particularly those that think strategically) are even looking beyond traditional rewards, attempting to solve customer problems and soothe pain points and occasionally even carving out a new niche in the process. Below, we highlight a handful of companies who’ve used loyalty programs successfully, along with some compelling restaurant loyalty stats, for those who still aren’t quite convinced.</p>
<h2>At Starbucks, Loyalty Drives Transaction Frequency</h2>
<p>With 12 million members in the U.S. alone, the Starbucks loyalty program is a well-known success story. The coffee giant launched the “My Starbucks Rewards Loyalty Program” in 2010. Comps accelerated shortly after, with the company calling the program &#8220;an overwhelming success&#8221; that drove both transaction frequency and average ticket size.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s evolved in the years since, most notably to include a digital ordering component known as Mobile Order &amp; Pay (offered only to loyalty members). Loyalty programs have demonstrated the most effectiveness when integrated into digital payment and ordering — which reinforces ease of use — and Starbucks is no exception. In 2016, it was reported that the company&#8217;s loyalty program held more money than some banks, with $1.2 billion in customer funds loaded onto plastic and mobile Starbucks cards as of the first quarter of the year. According to company filings, that number is now over $2 billion and has more than doubled in just two years (data shows the chain saw $621 million in funds loaded to the program in 2014).</p>
<p>Success hasn&#8217;t come without some blowback, however. The increased use of mobile-order-and-pay has caused friction between the chain and its employees, who argue Starbucks stores are not equipped to handle the increased volume brought on by the popularity of the loyalty program and its mobile order option, which has led to congestion in pick-up areas. Though mobile transactions spiked throughout U.S. stores in the most recent quarter, with 1,200 locations experiencing a 20% jump in mobile transactions, the increase in volume caused some customers to leave without making purchases. Starbucks is now aiming to address that with a revamp of its store designs and is currently testing a dedicated mobile order and pay-only store at its Seattle headquarters.</p>

<p>By the numbers:</p>
<p>• 13 million+ members (roughly 18 times the population of Seattle)<br />
• Membership has grown 11% in the past year<br />
• Transactions made using the loyalty program represented 36% of U.S. company-operated sales in the second quarter of 2017, according to company filings<br />
• Starbucks loyalty members’ average ticket size is three times that of the average customer</p>
<h2>25 Million Members Are Enrolled in Panera&#8217;s Loyalty Program</h2>
<p>Since launching rewards program My Panera in 2012, the chain now touts the largest such program in the industry, at 25 million members. Currently, half of all transactions come via the program, which relies heavily on an investment in <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-tech-investment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">technology and operations</a>.</p>

<p>Panera recently reported digital sales of more than $1 billion annually made via mobile, web or kiosk — a number projected to double in 2019. President Blaine Hurst has said that the success lies in the chain&#8217;s blend of digital innovation and &#8220;operational integrity,&#8221; which ultimately &#8220;translates to the kinds of sales we’re seeing today.”</p>
<p>By the numbers:</p>
<p>• More than 25 million members (which would equate to nearly 8% of the U.S. population)<br />
• As of Q1 2017, sales from mobile, web, and kiosks represented 26% of total company sales</p>
<h2>The Palm Rewards Diners in True High-End Fashion</h2>
<p>Like most restaurant loyalty programs, The Palm&#8217;s 837 Club rewards guests who return to the restaurant again and again. The difference, however, is that diners must pay to participate — a one-time fee of $25. The points redeemed, however, generate higher rewards than at other chains.</p>
<p>As it&#8217;s a fine-dining restaurant, users can redeem points for everything from complimentary desserts to weekend getaways, and receive invites to members-only events. In the twenty years since it was launched, the program has evolved, to offer more exclusive rewards and promotions for continued patronage. But despite the continual changes, the club remains in line with The Palm&#8217;s brand. As a high-end steakhouse, it makes sense that regulars would be treated to things like three-pound lobsters on their birthday or gift cards to Tiffany.</p>
<h2>Subway Evolves Beyond the Punch Card to Address Sales Slump</h2>
<p>Gone are the days of the &#8220;Buy Ten Subs, Get One Free&#8221; punch card. Subway&#8217;s loyalty program has evolved considerably over the years. The Subcard eventually became a Subcard app, complete with geotargeted promotions as well as custom sandwich-builder and calorie calculator features. And it isn&#8217;t just for U.S. diners. Subcard holders can also earn their way to free food with every purchase at Subway stores across UK and Ireland. In 2015, the sandwich chain began testing a link between its loyalty program and access to in-store Wi-Fi, offering customers in some Canadian Subway locations a free sandwich if they logged into the in-store Wi-Fi network.</p>

<p>Recently, the chain&#8217;s been looking to its app (and technology in general) to correct a sales slump. In January, Subway announced it would be introducing touch-screen ordering kiosks and a new mobile app (a bid to catch up with rivals like Panera) and, in a move straight from the Starbucks playbook, said it was also moving away from its five-decade-old format, by testing dedicated pickup areas for mobile orders. A newly revamped mobile app, introduced earlier this year, now includes a sandwich-customizing feature and is available in roughly 26,000 of the chain’s 27,000 U.S. stores.</p>
<p>By the numbers:</p>
<p>• The chain&#8217;s app garnered top place among quick-serve restaurant loyalty programs<br />
• &#8220;Very satisfied&#8221; rating for the program rose 31% between 2014 and 2015</p>
<h2>Dunkin&#8217; Donuts Saw Ticket Size Increase as a Result of Its Rewards</h2>
<p>The DD Perks Rewards Program was launched in January 2014 as a way to reward guests with points toward free beverages for every visit they make. Three years later, the program now touts more than six million members nationwide. The use of the rewards program, and the chain&#8217;s continued emphasis on digital, appears to be leading to larger ticket sizes.</p>
<p>In the second quarter of 2016, Dunkin&#8217; Donuts posted 0.5% growth in US same-store sales. Sales were down from 2.8% a year prior, but there was a bright side: though it saw decreased traffic, the chain noted rising average ticket size was driving same-store sales. Loyalty programs have been shown to increase a customer&#8217;s lifetime value by 30% or more through increased visit frequency and spend per visit.</p>

<p>By the numbers:</p>
<p>• More than 6 million members<br />
• On-the-Go ordering (offered only to loyalty members) was close to 2% of total sales during the first quarter of 2017</p>
<h2>Chipotle Went from 0 to 3.1 Million Loyalty Members in 3 Months</h2>

<p>Chipotle&#8217;s loyalty program was largely a move to get the chain on the right track after a widely reported food safety scandal. Many decried the sudden rollout of a rewards program which was launched quickly, only lasted three months, and didn&#8217;t appear to make any dent in terms of customer perception. But the program did provide some value to the chain, however short-lived it may have been.</p>
<p>The three-month &#8220;Chiptopia&#8221; program launched July 1, 2016. By the end of that month, the program already had more than 3.6 million participants and accounted for 30% of all transactions. At the end of the program, Chipotle said it had more than 3.1 million customers register and use their Chiptopia cards, with 85,000 participants visiting at least 11 times each month over the three months. Whether it won back lost customers, however, remains to be seen.</p>
<p>By the numbers:</p>
<p>• More than 3.1 million members in three months<br />
• Chiptopia accounted for 30% of all transactions within its first month</p>
<h2>The Restaurant Loyalty Program Space Continues to Grow</h2>
<p>There&#8217;s already an incredible amount of funding flowing into the loyalty space. MOGL, an online cash back service for dining at affiliated restaurants, has at least $44.94 million as a result of four rounds of funding from investors like Avalon Ventures and Sigma Partners. POS loyalty platform FiveStars underwent a $50 million funding round in 2016. LevelUp, a mobile payment platform that lets users accept mobile payments and engage with customers through loyalty programs, has an estimated $98 million in funding under its belt. Belly, which aims to &#8220;help businesses enhance digital connections to strengthen customer loyalty,&#8221; has $25.6 million. There are a slew of other companies in the restaurant loyalty space, too: Thanx, Perkville, Dealyze, Brink, and Paytronix among them.</p>
<p>As more loyalty providers enter the space (and, as chains begin to measure the success of their own programs), the programs will gain effectiveness. So, not only are loyalty programs impacting the restaurant industry currently — the way they do so will continue to evolve.</p>

<p>Already, many chains are incorporating gamification into their programs — offering rewards to those who complete a quiz or play a game (and collecting customer data in the process). While it might seem like a blip on the radar, games have eclipsed some of the largest social media sites in terms of daily users. Remember the Pokémon Go craze? At its height, the game surpassed Twitter in daily active users and eclipsed Facebook in engagement.</p>
<h2>Restaurant Loyalty Programs Offer the Most Value to Those Who Think Strategically</h2>
<p>Rewards drive the majority of the population — parting with our hard-earned money isn&#8217;t always easy, but getting rewarded for it lessens the blow. And, as it turns out, generally leads us to spend more. According to a 2016 report, 66% of consumers modify the amount they spend to maximize points — buying more and spending more than non-loyalty members (and resulting in a 5% &#8211; 10% revenue increase, on average).</p>
<p>The typical household owned an average of 13 loyalty cards in 2016, but the majority of these cards was inactive, highlighting the importance of ensuring a program is a strong fit for the chain.</p>
<p>As restaurants look to gain a competitive advantage, loyalty programs will continue to greatly expand. But chains can&#8217;t expect to launch a loyalty program and immediately see their revenue increase. While the benefits vary among each business, those who roll them out without a proper amount of strategic planning or foresight won&#8217;t reap the same benefits. Those who undertake the analysis required to launch such an important project will reap the largest rewards. The secret sauce will lie not just in increasing sales in the short-term, but in better understanding what a chain&#8217;s ideal customer looks like: when they come in, what they buy, and how much they spend.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From even a cursory glance at the restaurant marketplace, it’s evident that Cause Marketing has become an integral part of the restaurant business. Even in the worlds of QSR and fast-casual, people crave transparency and wholesomeness.</p>
<p>Cause marketing — the act of aligning a brand with a cause, to produce profitable and societal benefits for both parties — sounds a lot like philanthropy. But it’s actually more of a business strategy,  and a solid one at that, with regard to both customers and employees.</p>
<p>Think of cause marketing and corporate social responsibility (CSR) as related but separate, not synonymous. While important on its own, Cause Marketing is even more effective when leveraged with promotional cooperatives and partnerships with community influencers and other aligned organizations. Below are a few solid examples of restaurant chains that utilized cause marketing to their advantage:</p>
<h2>1. sweetgreen&#8217;s Wasted Salad</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-9612" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-02-at-4.14.58-PM-553x1024-1.jpg" alt="Sweetgreen restaurant chain cause marketing " width="361" height="668" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-02-at-4.14.58-PM-553x1024-1.jpg 553w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-02-at-4.14.58-PM-350x648.jpg 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-02-at-4.14.58-PM-162x300-1.jpg 162w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-02-at-4.14.58-PM-500x926-1.jpg 500w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-02-at-4.14.58-PM-300x556-1.jpg 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-02-at-4.14.58-PM-67x124-1.jpg 67w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-02-at-4.14.58-PM-49x90-1.jpg 49w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-02-at-4.14.58-PM.jpg 636w" sizes="(max-width: 361px) 100vw, 361px" /></p>
<p>In 2015, burgeoning fast-casual chain sweetgreen put its cause right on the menu with a salad comprised entirely of food waste — and asking diners to dig in. Were it any other moment in history — and any other chain — the move might not have worked. The ingredients in the “wastED” salad read like a veritable who’s-who of restaurant kitchen rejects: kale stems, cabbage cores, carrot peels, broccoli stalks, and bread butts. But the end result — a joint venture with renowned chef Dan Barber — was not only tasty, it was charitable.  Half of the proceeds of every $8.60 wastED salad went to City Harvest, a food rescue organization devoted to ending hunger.</p>
<p>One challenge of Cause Marketing lies in selecting the right cause in the first place. In the U.S., 43 percent of consumers want to see a company’s charitable efforts impact their community, so selecting a cause with a local presence is a good start. It also helps to keep guests informed. In this case, sweetgreen led by example, lending heavy exposure to the salad campaign on its own social channels and encouraging others to share, as well. Eventually, news of the salad made its way to dozens of high-profile media outlets — proof that Cause Marketing can also pay off in terms of <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/earned-media-restaurant-high-valuation">Earned Media</a>.</p>
<h2>2. Starbucks&#8217; Partners</h2>

<p>At Starbucks, baristas are more than workers — they’re “partners,” a term the coffee chain often uses when touting its employee benefits. Starbucks promises potential employees that working with Starbucks means they are “connected to something bigger,” and “inspiring positive change in the world around us.” It might sound overly flamboyant, but the company’s benefits greatly outweigh those at other food and beverage chains (Starbucks offers tuition reimbursement and health benefits for some employees).</p>
<p>For chains like Starbucks, touting a cause is beneficial on several fronts. Of course, there are the obvious reasons, like giving back to the community. But it also helps cut through the noise, differentiating a brand and improving a company’s reputation. It can even help attract (and keep) employees — which is why so many people who are proud to work for Starbucks likely wouldn’t be as proud to work for McDonald’s. In fact, six out of 10 Millennials cite “a sense of purpose” as part of the reason they chose to work for their current employer.</p>
<p>According to a Starbucks spokesperson, being interviewed by Business Insider back in 2014, the chain accepts only 1% of all applicants, simply because the number of applications it receives is so staggering.</p>
<p>In another stellar use of Cause Marketing, Starbucks teamed up with (RED) – the Global Fund to Fight Aids, donating 10 cents for every hand-crafted drink sold (at participating stores) in the U.S. and Canada. The campaign had a direct impact on sales and benefitted the organization in a big way, with the chain raising $12 million over the past seven years through the partnership.</p>

<p>Studies have shown that social purpose can often be the deciding factor for shoppers globally. When choosing between two brands of equal quality and price, 90% of U.S. shoppers are likely to switch to a cause-branded product. The trend isn’t specific to the U.S., either. Research shows 91% of global consumers are willing to switch brands to support companies tied to a charity. A further 50 percent of consumers across the globe are willing to spend more on a product associated with philanthropy.</p>
<p>Before its massive food safety scandal of 2015, Chipotle had squarely planted itself as the healthy, ethical choice among its peers. The company mission — to serve “food with integrity” — clearly resonated with consumers. While others were still serving up the same stale menus (frozen burgers Chipotle took the decidedly riskier route — slicing fresh avocados for its guacamole, grilling meat in full view of customers, and shunning microwaves in favor of classic cooking techniques. By positioning itself as a fresh alternative to traditional fast food, Chipotle enjoyed rapid growth. In its heyday, the chain was producing double-digit comps over the span of several quarters (comp sales for the third quarter of 2014 jumped nearly 20%).</p>
<h2>4. Subway&#8217;s Heart-Healthy Menu</h2>

<p>In 2012, Subway announced it would be the first restaurant chain to participate in the American Heart Association’s Heart-Check Meal Certification program, in which items that meet a required set of nutritional criteria can display the AHA mark. Even today, Subway’s homepage proudly touts the fact that it was the “first fast food restaurant to earn the American Heart Association Heart Check for heart-healthy meals.”</p>
<p>Of course, the chain still offers foot-long meatball subs, covered in sauce and cheese. But by aligning itself with an organization focused on health, Subway still manages to promote its brand and positioning. The Heart-Check mark works to boost consumer perception and trust, extending a halo of healthfulness (even if the sandwich stamped “heart healthy” isn’t all that healthy to begin with).</p>
<h2>5. White Castle Raises Awareness for Autism</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-9613" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-03-at-2.05.37-PM-1024x959-1.jpg" alt="White Castle restaurant chain cause marketing " width="455" height="426" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-03-at-2.05.37-PM-1024x959-1.jpg 1024w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-03-at-2.05.37-PM-350x328.jpg 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-03-at-2.05.37-PM-300x281.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-03-at-2.05.37-PM-768x719-1.jpg 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-03-at-2.05.37-PM-970x908-1.jpg 970w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-03-at-2.05.37-PM-500x468-1.jpg 500w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-03-at-2.05.37-PM-132x124-1.jpg 132w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-03-at-2.05.37-PM-96x90-1.jpg 96w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-03-at-2.05.37-PM.jpg 1164w" sizes="(max-width: 455px) 100vw, 455px" /></p>
<p>To highlight Autism Awareness Month (in April), White Castle has partnered with Autism Speaks since 2010. Customers are encouraged to purchase a puzzle-piece for $1, $3, or $5 to benefit the organization and, since 2010, the burger chain has raised more than $3 million. Additionally, the chain unveiled a limited-edition Original Slider-scented candle, with a portion of sales going to the organization. Since 2010, over 10,000 candles have sold to raise more than $100,000.</p>
<p>Increasing sales is, of course, persuasive. But cause marketing also makes consumers feel good, even when it requires little more than adding a dollar to their grocery bill. According to one study, 72% of consumers have donated to charity at the register and 65% of consumers felt positively about the retailer after giving.</p>
<h2>So Why Aren’t More Brands Engaged in Cause Marketing Efforts?</h2>
<p>For one thing, effective communication isn’t easy. In fact, surveys have found that 70% of Americans find companies’ communication about their social responsibility efforts confusing.</p>
<p>But equally problematic, especially in the restaurant industry, is that having a cause requires having a personality. And many restaurant chains are sorely lacking in the personality department. And brand personality is a critical component that must be clearly articulated before even attempting to embark on a Cause Marketing effort.</p>
<p>Once elements like brand positioning, brand promise, and brand story are outlined, settling on a charitable partner becomes much easier. People buy brands that reflect how they see themselves in the world. When they’re excited about a cause (and, by extension, a brand), customers will share it — with friends, via social media, etc. Having a brand promise and a brand personality that resonates with your core audience, yields a far greater chance of success than the stale companies who mimic the tactical movements of their competitors.</p>
<p>Put simply, doing good pays off. Many chains are looking for opportunities to be charitable. But in such a crowded marketplace, it’s increasingly difficult for those philanthropic efforts to stand out — all the more reason to have a cause marketing campaign tailored to fit your marketing strategy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The restaurant industry is an incredibly competitive one. While failure rates aren’t quite what has been claimed in some studies, the competitiveness has never been more intense. Emerging markets only add to that heightened competitive potency. (If you’re not convinced of that, read about the <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-ceo">25 things keeping restaurant CEOs awake at night</a>.) With so much change, devising a restaurant marketing budget grows more challenging by the day.</p>
<p>In the past 8 years, marketing budgets have moved double-digit percentages from traditional media to new media and omni-channel type programs. Those numbers are anticipated to continue accelerating, leading marketing officers around the globe to look at new ways to market their brand — and attempt to convince their CEO to buy in to the idea.</p>
<p>A Duke University poll of Chief Marketing Officers found that CMOs planned to increase their digital marketing spend by 14.7% over 2016, raising social media’s share of spend from 9.9% to 22.4% within the next five years. But a full 45% of those surveyed said they couldn’t actually demonstrate social media’s impact on their company performance. And it makes it difficult to convince a CEO to increase a restaurant marketing budget without proof that it will help the company in the long run. It might seem intimidating, but a few simple steps will ensure that a boss not only listens to your idea, but believes in it and approves it.</p>
<h2>1. Ask Your Boss What&#8217;s Most Important to the Company</h2>
<p>It’s easy to get caught up in the tactical, short-term, value-driven, shiny objects of the restaurant marketing world. Before you pitch&nbsp;a potentially harebrained idea to the company higher-ups, ensure that it’s well-thought-out and&nbsp;makes sense for the company. Marketing should be fun, but it also needs to be grounded in a strategic approach.</p>
<p>Bandwagon-ing (“everybody’s doing it”) is often the most used tactic (which we’ll touch on a little later), but taking on a project just for the novelty factor isn’t practical. Don’t make assumptions about what a C-suite executive needs or wants, based solely on observations. Instead, ask questions — this will allow for a better understanding of your boss’ point of view and ultimately, create more opportunity for success — for both of you.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that any new projects should be supportive of a brand’s foundation. Before any questions are asked, there should be documentation in place about what the company stands for: the brand’s promise, personality, positioning, and a well-articulated vision of its&nbsp;future. Any new projects&nbsp;should&nbsp;work to support&nbsp;those pillars of the company.</p>
<p>Provided the brand promise&nbsp;is clear and documented, here are some other questions to ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>What’s most important to the company this year?</li>
<li>What are our targets?</li>
<li>Do we have any new restaurant openings?</li>
<li>Are there going to be any substantive changes that will affect the employees or the guests (things like locations opening or closing, financial/corporate restructuring)?</li>
<li>What’s important to the CEO and to the company at large?</li>
<li>What are my KPIs? How will you measure the performance of my department, my functional area, and my team?</li>
<li>How does the company want to be known or perceived?</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Show them the Money (&amp; the Visuals)</h2>
<p>The most compelling case to a CEO will be one built on financial terms that aligns&nbsp;with greater strategic aims and company values. That means demonstrating how much a project will cost and how long it will take. But it also means showing that you’ve thought&nbsp;through the full scope of its potential impact on the budget and brand. Will this necessitate&nbsp;training or require new procedures? Will it alter stocking? How will it affect the&nbsp;supply chain?</p>
<p>As you’re able to identify problems, also suggest solutions and fixes. Provide the rationale, and concisely explain how you arrived at your estimates. This will increase both your profile and likelihood that you’ll grow through the organization.</p>
<p>For the busy CEO, visuals are key. Whomever you are going to present this to is a higher-up with multiple other competing priorities and demands — and far less bandwidth to consider a new project. Out of respect for their time, show it, don’t just say it. Provide bullet points, photographic evidence (including observations from the&nbsp;field, competitive insights, a usage case of in-store merchandising that isn’t working the right way, etc.) Visuals are key to demonstrating a larger point to someone who doesn’t have the time to read pages of documentation.</p>
<h2>3. Use Stats, Case Studies</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-9597" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Restaurant-Marketing-Copy-Cats-1024x281-1.jpg" alt="restaurant marketing budget copycats " width="980" height="269" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Restaurant-Marketing-Copy-Cats-1024x281-1.jpg 1024w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Restaurant-Marketing-Copy-Cats-350x96.jpg 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Restaurant-Marketing-Copy-Cats-300x82.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Restaurant-Marketing-Copy-Cats-768x211-1.jpg 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Restaurant-Marketing-Copy-Cats-970x266-1.jpg 970w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Restaurant-Marketing-Copy-Cats-500x137-1.jpg 500w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Restaurant-Marketing-Copy-Cats-220x60-1.jpg 220w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Restaurant-Marketing-Copy-Cats-160x44-1.jpg 160w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Restaurant-Marketing-Copy-Cats.jpg 1475w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px" /></p>
<p>A great number of restaurant chains are guilty of jumping on the bandwagon — offering a similar value meal, or new menu item, as all of their competitors. If there are areas in which your organization is grossly behind, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s the right thing for your brand. But providing examples is a good way of helping to nudge along a skeptical senior executive holding the purse strings.</p>
<p>A strategic marketing approach (one focused on distributing valuable, relevant content) helps retain a clearly-defined audience and increases the overall value of a brand. Studies have shown that content marketing, for instance, costs 62% less that traditional marketing, but generates about three times as many engagements — a stat that would likely prove compelling to a restaurant CEO.</p>
<p>Look to other industry benchmarks for proof, or at least a demonstration, of how investing in a new idea could help your organization maintain a competitive proposition. Gather examples — via social media, content marketing, improved ad campaigns, promotions, hiring of new people — to demonstrate how a project has proven successful among the competitive set. Benchmark against similar companies that have shown success in the area of interest, but keep in mind that simply copying a competitor isn’t exactly innovative. Case studies are helpful but true innovation never has footprints to follow.</p>
<h2>4. Make Forecasts</h2>

<p>The direction you’re facing is a sign of a maturing level of professionalism and responsibility. Typically, the lower end of an organization (the bookkeepers, for instance) are looking at what happened in the past. Meanwhile, the CEO will be forecasting quarters if not years out and planning capital investments that may stretch decades into the future.</p>
<p>Focus not just on where the industry is now, but where it’s headed. In some cases, there won’t be a wealth of this industry-specific data in terms of clear budget breakdowns. However,&nbsp;forecasts from other industries can be helpful, as well. Don’t simply look at what the company has or hasn’t done. Examine the bigger picture: What’s actually shaping up to influence the industry and how can my organization shape that? Demonstrate that you&#8217;ve done your&nbsp;homework by&nbsp;supporting the case with stats and facts.</p>
<h2>5. Compare &amp; Contrast</h2>
<p>There are ways to test a hypothesis before pitching a big-budget, full-system rollout. Can you do A/B split testing to validate some of your assumptions? A side-by-side comparison to see where your project stacks up to other benchmarks?</p>
<p>Sixty-seven percent of marketers cite “increasing sales on digital marketing campaigns” as a top priority this year. Yet a third of marketers say they don’t know which digital tactic has the biggest revenue impact. (Nearly one in five small businesses don’t track their digital efforts at all.) So, if you can gather stats from competitors, you’re already ahead of the pack.</p>
<h2>6. Think Like the CEO</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-9596" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Marketing-Strategy-Alignment-1024x273.png" alt="restaurant marketing budget executives" width="980" height="261" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Marketing-Strategy-Alignment-1024x273.png 1024w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Marketing-Strategy-Alignment-350x93.png 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Marketing-Strategy-Alignment-300x80.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Marketing-Strategy-Alignment-768x205.png 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Marketing-Strategy-Alignment-970x259.png 970w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Marketing-Strategy-Alignment-500x133.png 500w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Marketing-Strategy-Alignment-220x59.png 220w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Marketing-Strategy-Alignment-160x43.png 160w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Marketing-Strategy-Alignment.png 1421w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px" /></p>
<p>Everyone has a boss, even your CEO, who likely answers to a board and investors. Get in their headspace before requesting approval of a big project. How would your CEO ask for a comparable budget? Likely, by demonstrating its potential impact areas: not just how much it costs but how much it’s going to make. You get extra points if you can demonstrate the internal rate of return and the hurdle of the IRR of investments.</p>
<p>This means being short and succinct, but still offering a full explanation of a project&#8217;s impact in the long-term, and how it fits in to the larger structural goals and mandates of the CEO. Demonstrate that your recommendation links to an alignment of overarching corporate objectives, and you have a better chance of getting your budget approved — and doing the right thing for the company.</p>
<h2>7. K.I.S.S.</h2>
<p>Any document presented to a CEO should be self-sufficient. When presenting a case to a CEO, keep it short, simple, and don’t overcomplicate it. Provide pertinent details in a succinct manner, and wait to see if you’re asked questions. No questions could mean one of two things: Your proposal is being contemplated, or you’ve overstayed your welcome.</p>
<p>You will likely have to put in a lot of work to pitch a project to a CEO. The&nbsp;deliverable itself, however, should be simple. This doesn’t mean it was easy to produce or simplistic, but that it’s easy-to-understand. Engineer your pitch in a way that takes into account the attention span needs of a C-suite audience. Be careful also in this regard. If you’ve just burned a lot of company time putting together a lofty plan, be conscious of that. A CEO likely won’t be too pleased if you chased a new project while forsaking something you were actually asked to do.</p>
<p>In a way, it’s akin to engineering the guest experience at a restaurant. A lot of work has been put in to making the experience easier for the guest. But the end result makes the diner much more comfortable and at ease.</p>
<h2>8. Lay It on the Line</h2>
<p>Everyone should do work that they’re willing to take the fall for. A big opportunity for your company represents an opportunity for you and your career path as well.</p>
<p>A high-stakes internal pitch may seem like a lot of work and a lot of risk for little payoff, but with risk comes reward. It’s how great ideas came to be, and how great companies have been formed. If something is worth doing, it’s worth doing well. If your great idea doesn&#8217;t resonate,&nbsp;either you have the wrong idea, or you’re in the wrong place.</p>
<p>You never want to make a sloppy mistake. A mistake made in the pursuit of delivering something valuable&nbsp;to the organization, however, is a valiant and admirable failure. In fact, some organizations would consider that a strength. (But for starters, avoid these <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/common-restaurant-marketing-mistakes">common marketing mistakes</a>.)</p>
<h2>9. Call an Authority Figure</h2>
<p>Sometimes the best ideas are already within a company — it’s just a matter of unlocking it.</p>
<p>Often, it helps to have an unbiased, objective authority to pitch an idea. Some flash in the pan ideas don’t warrant making a strategic push, but others do. Keep in mind that your boss is under a lot of pressure to deliver. A third-party could give you a different understanding — and the CEO that extra push needed to okay the idea.</p>
<p>Getting a CEO or executive leadership on board with a new marketing project isn’t exactly an easy task. But demonstrating how a marketing project can&nbsp;set a restaurant apart from its competitive set (and that it can be directly tied to business outcomes) ensures a CEO understands its full impact.</p>
<p>Executive leadership wants to see&nbsp;that you’ve evaluated the landscape and know that the project is a good fit for the company. Once that&#8217;s been established, it&#8217;s easier to illustrate how a project&nbsp;fits in to the overall restaurant marketing budget. You’ll not only gain support from executives, but positive traction for the future of the company, and your own career.</p>
<p>Innovation has become a buzzword and, while everyone talks about it,&nbsp;there’s only a small percentage that’s actually comfortable in that space. Whenever anyone undertakes something truly innovative, they&#8217;re bound to run in to adversity.&nbsp;It&#8217;s a powerful lesson and message for marketers. But it&#8217;s equally poignant for restaurant chains in a stale and stagnant state of being (which we see particularly pronounced in the <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-recession-2017">casual dining restaurant category</a>). The herd mentality is no longer safe.&nbsp;Those who take risks, and serve as an example of bravery amongst the status quo, will reap the largest rewards.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The launch of Shake Shack’s first Korean franchise was a restaurant operator’s dream. Guests lined up hours in advance of the opening (some all night) to try the burgers at the latest outpost, nestled on Gangnam’s main thoroughfare in South Korea. The draw, at least according to most of the diners interviewed by Korean media, was word of mouth. News of the opening spread through social media, reaching a fever pitch that never quite died down. More than a month-and-a-half later, the Seoul location was still serving roughly 3,000 customers daily, or about four burgers per minute.</p>
<p>The fervor of a new Shake Shack location is rivaled only by the brand’s valuation, which sits somewhere around $1.4 billion. That works out to approximately $16.5 million per store — leaps and bounds ahead of rivals like Chipotle ($7.6 million) or Panera ($2.6 million). True, Shake Shack’s valuation is lofty, but it’s illustrative of a greater point: earned media can be a godsend for investors.</p>
<h3>FOR RESTAURANTS CHAINS, EARNED MEDIA EQUATES TO PURPOSE</h3>

<p>The most valuable brands in the world all have one thing in common: a purpose that resonates with consumers. Being written or talked about by someone other than yourself lends a brand a sense of credibility and resonance. It also helps boost staff morale and makes the team proud of where they work.</p>
<p>Look at Starbucks, whose legions of employees are proud to work of their company, thanks to its mission to “inspire and nurture the human spirit&#8221;. Many fast-food workers, meanwhile, aren’t as proud to tout their occupation. Who can blame them? It&#8217;s hard to take pride in a company that&#8217;s ineffective at spreading positive brand awareness and <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/associate-engagement-cost-of-pissed-off-employees-quantified">engaging associates</a>.</p>
<p>Storytelling is one of the most important skills for a brand. Not actively brainstorming ways to drive publicity — or setting a long-term plan to keep the drumbeat going — all but guarantees word-of-mouth will die out. A restaurant has to become something worth talking about.</p>
<h3>EARNED MEDIA CAN BE A MORE EFFECTIVE FORM OF PR THAN PAID MEDIA</h3>

<p>Word-of-mouth trumps a paid advertisement any day of the week. Anyone can buy an ad, but not just anyone can get written about. Studies suggest 92% of global consumers trust earned media above other forms of advertising, with word-of-mouth driving 20% &#8211; 50% of consumer purchase decisions. And earned media succeeds 10 &#8211; 15% more than paid media in terms of lead generation. Earned media is the most influential sort of PR. It not only engages brand advocates and fans but they, in turn, influence others. This is especially important for franchise systems growing an investor base. That influence also helps those looking to attract talented people and prized locations.</p>
<p>Public relations might seem overly vain, but an effective media relations campaign can actually be quite subtle. PR is also more effective at engaging a brand’s audience via social media networks than a traditional paid advertisement.</p>
<p>The success of fast food chain Chick-fil-A demonstrates how integral earned media can be. Chick-fil-A&#8217;s average unit volume (AUV) in 2015 was nearly $3.5 million — more revenue than any other U.S. fast food chain (KFC’s AUV was just $1 million). This, despite the fact that the chain spends far less on advertising than its fried chicken competitors. KFC, for instance, spent nearly $218 million on advertising in 2015, while Chick-fil-A spent just $73 million that same year. This means KFC spent 23% more on advertising, but Chick-fil-A had 250% the sales on a per-unit basis.</p>
<p>At times, Chick-fil-A’s values have caused controversy but, overall, they’ve imbued the brand with a sense of authenticity. Those values resonate with both employees (the chain is often voted among the top companies for culture and values) and customers. It touts one of the most loyal restaurant followings on Facebook, thanks to a mix of promotional messages and more personal content, like recipes from its blog, and updates about causes it supports.</p>
<p>In December 2016, the chain posted a video of its employees cheering on a Make-A-Wish patient before her performance at the Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl. The 14-second video was personable, contained no mention of Chick-fil-A’s product, and looks to be shot on an iPhone. It also elicited 112,000 views and 1.6 thousand likes (the same number KFC received on a professionally-edited video of its $10 chicken buckets).</p>
<h3>EARNED MEDIA CAN HAVE A DIRECT INFLUENCE ON A BRAND’S VALUATION</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9578" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-12-at-2.59.46-PM-1024x326-1.jpg" alt="Shake Shack Seoul line" width="980" height="312" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-12-at-2.59.46-PM-1024x326-1.jpg 1024w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-12-at-2.59.46-PM-350x111.jpg 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-12-at-2.59.46-PM-300x95.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-12-at-2.59.46-PM-768x244-1.jpg 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-12-at-2.59.46-PM-970x308-1.jpg 970w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-12-at-2.59.46-PM-500x159-1.jpg 500w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-12-at-2.59.46-PM-220x70-1.jpg 220w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-12-at-2.59.46-PM-160x51-1.jpg 160w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-12-at-2.59.46-PM.jpg 1214w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px" /></p>
<p>Valuation multiples help investors decide whether to buy or sell. A company’s multiple is affected by its perceived growth, risk and uncertainties, and investors’ willingness to pay. That multiple is partially generated through a brand’s story. Shake Shack shares trade at a valuation of 26 times enterprise value to 2017 EBITDA — versus its peer group at 14 times. There’s certainly an argument to be made that Shake Shack is overvalued. But at the height of the fever, it made some sense. Everyone was talking about <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/shake-shack-better-burger-bubble">better burgers</a>, so of course it would be worth more.</p>
<p>To the institutional investor who prefers to keep the same multiple when modeling an exit case, earned media can be a tool to demonstrate that valuation multiples can actually be increased during the holding period. Those looking to invest in a company need to be assured that there’s an opportunity to grow the business. That opportunity becomes more clear when an investor can say, “People are talking about this — just think of all that you could do with it.”</p>
<p>Improving a company’s profitability and performance is, of course, paramount. In our past work, we’ve found that earned media can also increase the multiple at which a company is sold. Essentially, earned media is a fairly speedy and proven way to drive a valuation higher.</p>
<h3>SOUNDS EASY ENOUGH. SO WHY AREN’T MORE PEOPLE INVESTING IN EARNED MEDIA?</h3>
<p>To be fair, failing to invest in earned media is a common <u>restaurant marketing mistake</u>. Restaurant chains often don’t grasp the full value of earned media. Without the full support and buy-in of the company, it’s difficult to put a media relations strategy into practice (or even formulate one in the first place).</p>
<p>Earned media is the vehicle that compels people to patronize a brand or buy a product. Why buy advertisements claiming you have great burgers when you could instead prove it — all without buying a single ad? But that’s often easier said than done.</p>
<p>Fortunately, those with the right industry expertise can guide chains through the process. The modern digital landscape gives every restaurant chain the opportunity to tell its story. But first, that message must be crafted and honed. For a business to stay competitive, creating awareness is key. Formulating effective earned media strategies will not only enhance a brand’s reputation, but increase its bottom line, as well.</p>
