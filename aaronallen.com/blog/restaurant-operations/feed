				<p>If ever there were a time to invest in restaurant menu strategy, surely it should be now. The issues of labor shortages, supply chain constraints, cost inflation, optimization for digital and delivery, brand differentiation, enhanced productivity, kitchen complexity, bottlenecks, guest experience, order accuracy, maintaining relevance and competitiveness — nearly all of these issues have roots in the menu.</p>
<p>To get it right requires a CEO-level mandate, as such an initiative involves a dedicated team authorized to work across functional lines and hierarchies for weeks on end (which is why so few chains harvest the full value such an endeavor can yield when done properly). It can be time-consuming, laborious, and costly; but it can also meaningfully contribute to profitable revenue growth as well as benefit the organization across a wide spectrum of intangibles.</p>
<p>Menu engineering is the spring cleaning equivalent in the industry. Menus, SKUs, inventory, POS data, etc. — they tend to attract clutter just like a utility drawer. Not everyone enjoys cleaning out and organizing a messy garage or attic, but everyone does feel better once it&#8217;s done.</p>

				<h3>It&#8217;s Time to Free the Guest from the Tyranny of Choice</h3><p>Humans have a remarkable ability to over-complicate. Some studies show that the average person makes an overwhelming 35,000 choices per day.</p><p>While we all think we want more options, this comes with a paradox of choice. There is such a thing as too many options. This has certainly been true in recent years for restaurant chains that lacked the discipline to prune and <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/menu-strategy">manicure their menus</a>.</p>					</div>

				<h2>Effective Menu Strategy Must Be Holistic</h2><p>One of the surest and quickest means to improving performance for a restaurant chain is through effective menu engineering strategies. It’s about more than tactical design, merchandising techniques, promotional tactics, and pricing strategies though.</p><p>When done correctly, a holistic improvement is possible that also delivers benefits in terms of operational efficiency, brand and competitive differentiation, media interest that garners positive publicity, guest appeal that stimulates new trial and frequency, sustainable lifts to sales and profitability, and even reinvigorated morale and employee engagement at the unit level.</p><p>We help with quantitative analysis led by data scientists and then incorporate findings into new product, pricing, presentation, and positioning recommendations. Working with your designers, our team provides menu engineering insights (placement, descriptions, menu psychology, behavioral economics, industrial engineering principles, etc.) to showcase and improve menu merchandising, resulting in an immediate impact for same-store sales growth and meaningful margin improvements.</p>					</div>

				<p>Margins are being compressed for restaurants and foodservice operators around the world. Nearly every geography, cuisine, and operating model is being hit with increased costs relative to rent, labor, commodities, demands of modernization, competitive pricing and promotional tactics designed to take share, and a more fickle and demanding consumer with rapidly evolving dining behaviors.</p>
<p>From Middle America to the <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-margins-shrinking">Middle East</a> and everywhere in-between, there is spotty revenue growth with unique brands and <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/alternative-foodservice-formats">hybrid formats</a> that is coming at the cost of <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/casual-dining-restaurant-chains-entering-dangerous-waters">lumbering incumbents</a> torn between two competing notions: drive revenue or cut costs.</p>
<p>But the choice doesn’t have to be binary. Both can be done simultaneously while catching a wider net of performance improvements — banded together through a single improvement initiative — &nbsp;that can also prove powerful as a catalyst for wider organizational and financial transformation.</p>
<p>As we’ve said before, the menu is the single most important piece of marketing collateral that a restaurant has, and every great restaurant turnaround worked its way from the inside out — originating from the heart of the house, expressed through brand purpose and positioning, and manifesting itself through the menu and other vital stakeholder touchpoints.</p>
<p>Whether you’ve embarked on a <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-brand-audit">brand audit</a>, a <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-brand-refresh">brand refresh</a>, or a full-on turnaround, revitalizing a restaurant’s menu is one of the most complex — yet surest and fastest — ways to improve profitability.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Here&#8217;s How Menu Engineering Can Help&nbsp;</h2>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><strong>Revenue Growth</strong> – A 2% increase in sales is equivalent to a 10% reduction in cost. A well-engineered menu can drive check average, new trials, frequency, party size, and advocacy by identifying opportunities for upsells and add-ons, new profit centers, limited time offers (LTOs), bounce backs, and new products.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Food and Beverage Costs</strong> – There are a number of <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/launching-a-new-menu">questions to be asked</a> when identifying <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/how-to-reduce-restaurant-food-cost">ways to improve food costs</a>. To be sure though, they can’t be improved sustainably by simply increasing prices across the board, reducing portion sizes, and swapping out ingredients for lower-priced (and lesser-quality) alternatives. Menus can and should function like a tour guide to help navigate guests to items that are not just more profitable, but also that are <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/how-to-market-a-restaurant#6">signature items</a> (the Cayman Curse is our most straightforward and time-tested <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/how-to-market-a-restaurant#6">example</a>) that can enhance brand positioning and perception while also supporting margin growth.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Labor</strong> – With the menu making an impact across all functional areas of the business, it can influence make/buy decisions, inform discussions about insourcing or outsourcing a commissary kitchen, and &#8211; properly approached &#8211; a menu overhaul can certainly be an effective lever for wider&nbsp;<a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-labor-optimization-strategies" rel="noopener">labor optimization</a>&nbsp;efforts. When you get into the nuts and bolts of margin improvement through the lens of a holistic menu strategy, you will undoubtedly find ways to optimize labor (best done by balancing the guest experience, operational process improvements, and utilization metrics).</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Marketing</strong> – When done well, menus help garner free publicity, gain priceless&nbsp;<a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/earned-media-restaurant-high-valuation" rel="noopener">earned media</a>,&nbsp;and give something to talk about internally and externally in such a way that can seriously drive revenues and advocacy. These kinds of initiatives give a good reason for external messaging, versus marketing simply for the sake of marketing. An understanding of behavioral economics and both pricing and&nbsp;<a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/the-psychology-of-menu-design" rel="noopener">menu psychology</a>&nbsp;are becoming requisites of the modern foodservice marketer.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Market Share</strong> – Think of any of the most successful restaurant turnarounds in recent history and you will find a commonality; those who have been gaining share at their competitors’ expense leveraged the menu as a central part of their strategy. Right? Can you think of any examples worth mentioning that this wasn’t the case? Market share gains are not just about effective marketing or a lucky card draw. The category leaders thrust themselves forward with a well-choreographed and charismatic campaign that was either centered on the menu or considered it central to their efforts. They weren’t handed gains, they won them with their menu engineering strategy emblazoned on the shield and sword they fought with.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Enterprise Value</strong> – Everyone wants to be associated with a winner, and meaningful menu improvements can help create the momentum to grow sales, margins, and win the hearts and minds of those who matter most (inside and outside the business). When you get the menu right, you will enjoy benefits not only to the P&amp;L but also on the balance sheet. Transformations born out of the heart-of-the-house (brand positioning, product development, enrolling stakeholders, etc.) clearly equate to top-quartile performance with regard to other <a href="https://aaronallen.com/restaurant-finance">fundamentals of finance</a> — like the balance sheet. Those getting it right with their menu strategy are also rewarded with growth of intangibles and intrinsic value of the enterprise they are entrusted with enhancing.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Because of the nature of the incrementalism and organizational inertia that can sometimes be hard to beat, menus are often developed based on the momentum of what was there before (that and more&nbsp;<a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-menu-design-mistakes">common menu mistakes to avoid</a>&nbsp;here).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many organizations tout the&nbsp;<a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-industry-innovation" rel="noopener">virtues of innovation</a>&nbsp;while also lacking the internal will or systems required to create and implement change on a holistic and seismic level. That also means, usually those who are responsible for the rollout of the menu are either trapped in a committee consensus environment, lack the organizational influence, or are wary of risking internal political capital to shake things up in a meaningful way.</p>
<h2>Menu Engineering Across Functional Areas</h2>
<p>Since nearly every functional area is touched by the menu (supply chain, marketing, operations, training, culinary and beverage development teams, finance) and will require&nbsp;<a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/technology-in-restaurants" rel="noopener">buy-in and winning over critical stakeholders</a> (support center team, field- and unit-level operations, external supply and distribution partners, franchisees, financiers, crew-level teams, media, and most especially the guest), it serves as a central point of senior-level influence.</p>
<p>While many view the menu like maintenance — something that needs touch-up paint and an oil change — influential category leaders have leveraged menu engineering as a means to stage a turnaround and reinvigorate a system.</p>
<p>The tools and techniques can be as black and white as the ebony and ivory of a piano but remain as elusive as the perfect symphony or composition when left to less-skilled hands. The music here requires both stylistic artistry and technical mastery. It’s deceptively simple; getting the right chords, rhythm, harmony, balance, and a beat that both soothes the soul and exudes the shared spirit and enthusiasm (a brand, company, product, community, shareholders, stakeholders, and the rest of it). When you get those things just right, though, you can not only improve sales and margins, you can bring something into the world that inspires others and stands the test of time.</p>					</div>

				<h2>It’s time to free the guest from the tyranny of too many choices.</h2><p>Humans have a remarkable ability to over-complicate. And this has certainly been true in recent years for restaurant chains that lacked the discipline to prune and manicure their menu strategy.  </p><p>Much like the sense of surprise and panic of looking at the bathroom scale late in the holiday season and feeling startled enough to get back into the gym and cut a few pounds, marketers — and those responsible for menu rollouts — are realizing they need to drop some weight. </p><p>Many clients have asked us for help with menu engineering, and we’ve noticed a few common stumbling blocks. Promotional items and limited-time offers get confused with product development, leading to lower-priced — and lower-impact — menus. Redesign efforts are often assigned to junior teams, who lack the experience and authority to take a holistic approach to menu development and make the necessary decisions. To combat these, we suggest:</p><ul><li>Aligning the menu with consumer trends to create innovative signature items</li><li>Devoting research and development efforts to the culinary program, which will be repaid as the new menu creates improvements across functional areas</li><li>Elevating redesign efforts to the C-Suite, so that menu engineering becomes part of the chain’s long-term strategic planning</li></ul><h2>Pricing Tactics Masquerading as Innovations</h2><p>With all the noise and fervor around <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-industry-innovation">innovation</a>, it is interesting to note that much of what is happening on menus has more to do with promotions and pricing strategy than it does with R&amp;D, differentiated product development, and meaningful improvements in the areas of speed of service, order accuracy, guest convenience, and operational efficiency.  </p><p>As chains struggle with shrinking sales, they often face pressure from shareholders to cut SG&amp;A costs, which include culinary development. This sometimes means relying on large distributors for help with menu development, resulting in lots of brands suddenly offering very similar options — precisely what happened to <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/how-to-market-a-restaurant#6">some British pubs</a> just after the 2008 crisis.</p><p>We need only look at the sad state of <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/casual-dining-restaurant-chains-entering-dangerous-waters">casual-dining chains</a> to see the consequences of this mistake. Rather than find new approaches to menus that would delight guests and align with a brand’s unique promise, personality, and positioning, these chains drifted into the sea of same.</p>					</div>

Innovating exciting <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/how-to-market-a-restaurant#6">signature items</a> would have had the opposite effect, helping them stand out from other concepts both within and outside the category. The menu is a key part of the experience of dining out, and innovation can help refresh a stale brand.</p><h2>We Eat with Our Eyes First, So Keep the Design Simple, Too</h2><p><strong> </strong>The menu is a chain’s most important piece of marketing collateral, and it should be its best salesperson. But just as menus can end up cluttered with limited-time offers that no one had the heart to kill, they can also end up looking like the design department threw every font, color combination, and Photoshop filter at the page just to see what would stick. Even if there are relatively few items on each page, visual confusion spreads to the guests, who aren’t sure how to navigate the menu.</p>					</div>

				<p>With 60% of QSR revenue coming through the drive-thru, these slowdowns can significantly damage performance.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Starbucks Needs a Food Formula</h2>
<p>Starbucks has also struggled to get its drive-thru performance right. The chain established an effective formula for ordering from its drink menu: size (venti), hot or iced, drink name (vanilla latte), and any additions or changes (no whip, quad shot). This system makes it easy for guests and baristas to navigate an incredibly complex set of offerings. In fact, it works so well, Starbucks has radically simplified its menu boards, showing only a handful of drinks, with pricing and nutritional information for the grande size only.</p>					</div>

				<p>Among some of the top QSR players in the U.S., those with the simplest menus saw 2.7x as many transactions per item (considering the median of the group) as those with the most complex menus. This underlines the profound impact of menu strategy on what will surely be one of the biggest stories in foodservice in 2019: labor.</p><h2>Labor Challenges Must Also be Met with Improved Menu Strategy</h2><p>Restaurants have benefitted from favorable commodity costs in many geographies globally. Even still, restaurants had price inflation 3x that of grocery stores.</p><p>With labor costs increasing around the world in 2019 — and competitive pressures continuing to build — getting it right with the menu will be very important. Labor will not only become more expensive though; in some key markets the labor pool is really a labor puddle, making it especially difficult to fill positions that require skilled crews.</p><p>Improvements should happen through the lens of product development, day-part and profit center growth opportunities, pricing strategies, labor optimization strategies, enhancements to the guest experience and to operational systems to increase speed of service and order accuracy and reduce unit-level complexity.</p><h2>Menu Strategy Must Be Holistic</h2><p>One of the surest and quickest means to improving performance for a restaurant chain is through effective menu engineering strategies. It’s about more than tactical design, merchandizing techniques, promotional tactics and pricing strategies though. When done correctly, a holistic improvement is possible that also delivers benefits in terms of operational efficiency, brand and competitive differentiation, media interest that garners positive publicity, guest appeal that stimulates new trial and frequency, sustainable lifts to sales and profitability, and even reinvigorated morale and employee engagement at the unit level.</p><h3>About Aaron Allen &amp; Associates</h3><p><a href="https://www.aaronallen.com/about-us">Aaron Allen &amp; Associates</a> works alongside senior executives of the world’s leading foodservice and hospitality companies to help them solve their most complex challenges and achieve their most ambitious aims. We have helped evaluate and engineer menus for some of the world’s largest restaurant brands, as well as helped restaurant companies around the world drive revenues, increase profits, and enhance the guest experience through improved marketing, messaging, and menu engineering. </p><p>Our clients span six continents and 100+ countries, collectively posting more than $200b in revenue.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="Body">Because food costs consume between 25% and 35% of a restaurant operation’s revenue, management teams make great efforts to avoid waste. In fact, only about 4% of food in American restaurants goes to waste — much better than in household consumption, where an estimated 40% of groceries are thrown away.</p>
<p class="Body">Though 4% seems small, it points to a serious problem. Collectively, restaurants across the United States waste $25b a year — the equivalent of the 2017 U.S. sales for Starbucks and Panera combined — on food that will never be eaten. They throw out 11.4m tons of usable ingredients, the equivalent of about 1.5b meals.</p>

<p>Food waste contributes to a number of pressing social issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 in 7 Americans (nearly 47m) face hunger every year</li>
<li>34% of methane gas released into the atmosphere comes from food rotting in landfills</li>
<li>Americans spend $218b on uneaten food annually</li>
</ul>
<p>Some nonprofits and restaurant operations are taking action to tackle this costly — in more ways than one — habit.</p>
<h2 class="Body">Prevent Food Waste, Recover Unused Product, and Recycle the Rest</h2>
<p class="Body">ReFED (Rethink Food Waste Through Economics and Data), a not-for-profit based in San Francisco, is committed to reducing food waste in the U.S. Their recently released <span class="Hyperlink0"><a href="https://www.refed.com/downloads/Restaurant_Guide_Web.pdf#page=6"><i>Restaurant Food Waste and Action Guide</i></a>&nbsp;</span>lays out a plan to reduce waste by 20%, adding $100b of cumulative economic value over the next decade.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11748" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/restaurant-food-waste-dumpsters.jpg" alt="restaurant food waste dumpsters" width="974" height="650" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/restaurant-food-waste-dumpsters.jpg 974w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/restaurant-food-waste-dumpsters-350x234.jpg 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/restaurant-food-waste-dumpsters-300x200-1.jpg 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/restaurant-food-waste-dumpsters-768x513-1.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 974px) 100vw, 974px" /></p>
<p class="Body">The first step is prevention, which could save restaurants nearly $620m annually. Recovery entails donating unused food to food banks and other non-profits that help feed millions of food-insecure Americans all over the country. And, by taking unused foods to composting facilities, farms, or plants that turn waste into electricity and fertilizer through anaerobic digestion, restaurant operators can give their ingredients a second chance.</p>
<p>Here are four ways to reduce waste in kitchens from the moment the delivery truck arrives.</p>
<h3 class="Body">1. Vacuum Sealing Portions Will Save Thousands of Pounds of Food Annually</h3>
<p class="Body">An individual restaurant can prevent between 25k and 75k in food waste each year by approaching the prep phase strategically.</p>
<p class="Body">Most prep lists already include portioning, which helps kitchen staff push out meals quickly. If kitchens add the additional step of vacuum sealing portions, it can extend their shelf life.</p>
<h3 class="Body">2. Inventory Analytics Can Reduce Food Costs 2%–6%</h3>
<p class="Body">Daily inventory tracking allows operators to make more accurate orders and plan the menu according to supply levels. This can be done manually, but software companies have created customized dashboards that continually track sales of menu items, taking them out of the inventory when they’ve run out.</p>
<p class="Body">These programs can save managers 30–50 hours of spreadsheet work per month and could help operators cut food costs by 2%–6%.</p>
<h3 class="Body">3. Smaller Plates Mean Less Waste</h3>
<p class="Body">Diners leave an average of 17% of their meal behind, largely thanks to U.S. restaurants’ increasing portion sizes. Operators could reverse this trend by switching to smaller plates, which would make a more reasonable portion.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11756" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/restaurant-food-waste-portion-sizes.jpg" alt="" width="974" height="647" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/restaurant-food-waste-portion-sizes.jpg 974w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/restaurant-food-waste-portion-sizes-350x232.jpg 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/restaurant-food-waste-portion-sizes-300x199-1.jpg 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/restaurant-food-waste-portion-sizes-768x510-1.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 974px) 100vw, 974px" /></p>
<p class="Body">Of course, restaurants want to ensure their guests have the best possible experience, and a lot of that depends on the food. Typically, a plate must be 70% full to appeal to diners. While most people would notice decreasing portion sizes on larger plate, they won’t notice if the serviceware shrinks accordingly.</p>
<h3 class="Body">4. Bank on Sustainability</h3>
<p class="Body">Some restaurants are already implementing more sustainable practices in their kitchens. In New York, Haven’s Kitchen reserves a section of their walk-in for leftover kitchen trim, which the bar might use as garnishes — placing a kale stem in a Bloody Mary, for example. The practice has sparked a conversation about food waste reduction, and Haven’s Kitchen has added a unique factor to the overall dining experience with this creative and cost-effective change.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11757" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/restaurant-food-waste-sustainability.jpg" alt="" width="974" height="647" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/restaurant-food-waste-sustainability.jpg 974w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/restaurant-food-waste-sustainability-350x232.jpg 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/restaurant-food-waste-sustainability-300x199-1.jpg 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/restaurant-food-waste-sustainability-768x510-1.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 974px) 100vw, 974px" /></p>
<h2 class="Body">Doing Good Is its Own Reward</h2>
<p class="Body">While restaurants are making strides to reduce food waste, consumers are taking note and supporting those establishments that push for more sustainable practices. A recent study revealed that 72% of Americans care about how food waste is handled, and almost half are more likely to dine at restaurants that actively recover food.</p>
<p class="Body">Through prevention, recycling, and recovery measures, restaurants can increase their bottom line while reducing the amount of time and money they throw away. For every dollar invested in food waste reduction, restaurants can see $8 in savings. This practice could add up to $1.9b in profit potential annually.</p>
<p class="Body">Ending food waste is easier — and more rewarding — than many restaurant operators might think.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Once a fairly humble piece of paper, the menu has evolved to become one of the most complex components of one of the most complex businesses in the world. Restaurant menus are a convergence of nearly every other facet of the business: marketing, supply chain, interaction, design, fulfillment production, copywriting, merchandising, etc. When combined effectively, they form the single most important piece of marketing collateral a restaurant can have. But as menus have changed over the years, so has their design — and menu merchandising is now a bigger challenge (and greater opportunity) than ever before. When it comes to technology&#8217;s impact on modern-day <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-menu-design" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">menu design</a> and menu merchandising, we&#8217;re seeing something that&#8217;s absolutely brand new; something that will disrupt the industry in ways we couldn&#8217;t have imagined ten years ago. Fortunes will be made and lost over the next few years based on how well companies understand — and ultimately utilize — these technologies. It sounds like a tall order, to be sure</p>
<h1>The Evolution of Menu Merchandising</h1>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10605" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/mcdonalds-menu-merchandising.jpg" alt="mcdonalds menu merchandising" width="2002" height="406" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/mcdonalds-menu-merchandising.jpg 2002w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/mcdonalds-menu-merchandising-350x71.jpg 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/mcdonalds-menu-merchandising-300x61.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/mcdonalds-menu-merchandising-768x156-1.jpg 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/mcdonalds-menu-merchandising-1024x208-1.jpg 1024w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/mcdonalds-menu-merchandising-970x197-1.jpg 970w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/mcdonalds-menu-merchandising-500x101-1.jpg 500w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/mcdonalds-menu-merchandising-220x45-1.jpg 220w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/mcdonalds-menu-merchandising-160x32-1.jpg 160w" sizes="(max-width: 2002px) 100vw, 2002px" /> Tens of millions of dollars have been poured in to understand menu <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/the-psychology-of-menu-design" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">psychology</a>, merchandising, and engineering over the years. Yet some of those principals are as old as evolution itself: having things stand out in evolutionary (it&#8217;s the reason our instincts kick in when we see a lion hiding in a bush, for instance. We&#8217;re trained to notice if something is different than its surroundings.) These techniques have lately begun to evolve even further and faster. While some techniques remain tried and true, there are new pieces to the puzzle: interface design in kiosks and apps, for instance, the design of a mobile menu, etc. The $4 trillion global restaurant industry is one of many struggling with the fact that the consumer is moving faster than most restaurant chains can even comprehend. Many are left in a state of flux, while other chains are seeing tremendous growth thanks to emerging technologies — and reaping the rewards in terms of both higher stock prices and customer happiness.</p>
<h1>How New Ways of Dining Are Impacting Menu Merchandising</h1>
<p>New restaurant technologies (digital menus, mobile app ordering, kiosks, interface design) are beneficial for many reasons. For one thing, merchandising is already built into many mobile order technologies. It&#8217;s not always possible to track whether servers are up-selling to each customer, for instance. Not only is this good for guests (in terms of the convenience of seeing popular items called out on a menu), but it&#8217;s good for operations, leading to faster purchasing and ordering decisions and higher order accuracy. Technology certainly has its benefits — but it comes with a unique set of challenges, too. For operators, technology greatly enhances the capabilities of menu merchandising, into the realm of things like neuro-marketing, for instance. Neuro-marketing (which uses medical technologies such as functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to study the brain’s responses to marketing stimuli) isn’t even on the horizon for many chains. Other restaurant companies, meanwhile (Starbucks, Domino&#8217;s, Pizza Hut, etc.) are actively investing in technology like machine learning, AI, advanced algorithms for menus and self-ordering.</p>
<h1>Why Proper Menu Merchandising is Critical</h1>
<p>Sixty-five percent of every dollar a restaurant brings in, goes back out in food and labor costs. Such slim margins make it even more important to ensure there&#8217;s not too much waste (and therefore describe menu items in a way that’s compelling and unique). Restaurants that aren&#8217;t managing that well will likely see guest experience suffer as a result. If a pizza restaurant is consistently out of pepperoni, for instance, it&#8217;s probably a sure bet that their traffic will begin to decline. Psychology and biology both play a role. If a menu is merchandised such that the most profitable items are placed in the areas where people look the most, that can give a restaurant a tremendous advantage. Those techniques have been applied to menus for decades, of course, though the evolution is astounding: sure, more chains are turning to nested pricing (which allows guests to focus on the headline and item description rather than its price), but they&#8217;re also utilizig 3D techniques and animation on digital menus. The latest techniques can sequence how guests consume information, walking them through a menu in a logical way that makes the ordering process feel much easier and more intuitive. There can be too much of a good thing, though. Over-do it, and a restaurant can create a conflict for the guest: a paradox of choice. If too many items look too good, a guest often feels as if they&#8217;ve missed out on something good. Lately, some chains have caught on to the paradox of choice. Some casual dining chains, which historically lacked the displicine to remove older items after unveiling newer ones, have lately been revealing re-vamped, <a href="https://today.yougov.com/news/2017/10/12/chilis-new-menu-generates-purchase-consideration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slimmed-down menus</a>.</p>
<h1>The Menu Merchandising Mix</h1>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10606" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/technology-menu-merchandising.jpg" alt="technology menu merchandising" width="940" height="888" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/technology-menu-merchandising.jpg 940w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/technology-menu-merchandising-350x331.jpg 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/technology-menu-merchandising-300x283.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/technology-menu-merchandising-768x726-1.jpg 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/technology-menu-merchandising-500x472-1.jpg 500w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/technology-menu-merchandising-131x124-1.jpg 131w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/technology-menu-merchandising-95x90-1.jpg 95w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px" /> The best menu merchandising is a blend — an analysis of what&#8217;s profitable, as well as a knowledge of engineering side, and merchandising techniques. Because so much is involved, it&#8217;s not as easy as simply uploading a menu to a website. Today, it&#8217;s about optimizing a menu for mobile, for web speeds, etc. Those who get it right carve out a tremendous advantage for themselves in the process. On average, our clients have witnessed $12,000 in net profit increase per million dollars in revenue just by re-arranging the items on their menus. By analyzing what items are selling, what&#8217;s not selling — and applying proper engineering techniques (the structure of the document) and merchandising techniques (the design of the document) — can dramatically impact what guests buy and how they interact with a menu.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As far as natural disasters go, Fall 2017 is off to a rough start. In August, Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas, stranding thousands in their homes, and leading to widespread flooding across densely populated areas like Houston. Just days later, the Category 5 Irma barreled toward Florida, leaving a wake of destruction in its path. Shortly after Irma destroyed more than 90% of the small island of Barbuda, the island found itself under yet another Hurricane Watch, with Hurricane José following close behind. In fact, there was a trifecta of disaster, with three named storms (Irma, Harvey, and Katia) bearing down on America.</p>
<p>Other parts of the world were hit hard, as well. While the Northwest US was battling wildfires, South Asia was scrambling to recover from floods that affected an estimated 40 million across India, Bangladesh, and Nepal. A magnitude-8.1 earthquake struck southern Mexico in September. In addition to the countless homes affected, businesses were hit too — including restaurants, both mom-and-pops and chains alike.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no real &#8220;restaurant disaster recovery plan&#8221; playbook because, put simply, no two disasters are the same. But restaurants have recovered — and helped others recover — in a myriad of ways. In times like these, a restaurant might need <span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;emergency boiler rental&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:4227,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;4&quot;:[null,2,11982760],&quot;10&quot;:2,&quot;15&quot;:&quot;Arial&quot;}">to provide a temporary or short-term solution in providing an additional steam output when a facility experiences an emergency shutdown.</span></p>
<h1>THE WAFFLE HOUSE INDEX</h1>
<p>The destruction following the massive May 2011 tornado in Joplin, Missouri, was unthinkable. Homes were demolished. Shingles had been ripped off the tops of schools. Dozens were missing. But amongst the wreckage, the yellow florescent signs of two area businesses stood out like shining beacons of light: Joplin&#8217;s two Waffle House restaurants were open. The chain of 24-hour diners have since become unlikely tools of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), used to measure of the severity of a storm. Craig Fugate, former FEMA Administrator, has even said, &#8220;If you get [to a disaster-ravaged area] and the Waffle House is closed? That’s really bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because Waffle House notoriously stays open through nearly every type of weather, the restaurant&#8217;s operations (or lack thereof) in the wake of a storm have become a measure for its intensity. It&#8217;s known as FEMA&#8217;s &#8220;Waffle House Index&#8221; and it looks something like this:</p>

<p>As a privately-owned company, Waffle House has comparatively fewer resources at its disposal as many other organizations that aid in disaster relief, making its reputation for disaster-response even more noteworthy.</p>
<h1>RESTAURANTS GIVE TO THE COMMUNITY IN THE WAKE OF DISASTER</h1>

<p>Often, restaurant disaster recovery is less about the restaurant itself, and more about the community at large. In August 2017, in the wake of Hurricane Harvey, Texas-based fast food chain <strong>Whataburger</strong> pledged $1 million to its Whataburger Family Foundation, $150,000 of which would go toward the Red Cross, and $500,00 to local food banks. Additionally, the burger chain donated food to first responders in the Houston area, making headlines after posting a video of a first responder taking his first bite of Whataburger and exclaiming, in a thick New York accent, &#8220;That is a good burger.&#8221;</p>
<p><center></p>

<p></center></p>
<p><strong>Yum China Holdings</strong> (which operates brands including KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell) committed more than half-a-million dollars to support relief efforts following a 7.0-magnitude earthquake that struck Jiuzhaigou County in Sichuan Province in August 2017. The donation was made through the China Foundation for Poverty Alleviation and aims to contribute to the post-disaster reconstruction and recovery program.</p>
<p><strong>Anheuser-Busch</strong> has made a name for itself in terms of disaster recovery efforts, too, often pausing beer-bottling operations to instead produce thousands of cans of water to be delivered to disaster zones. The company periodically halts brewery production throughout the year at its Cartersville, Georgia brewery so it can be prepared to &#8220;help American communities in times of need.&#8221; It sent more than 155,000 cans of safe drinking water to aid those hit by Hurricane Harvey in Texas and Louisiana.</p>
<h1>RESTAURANTS AIM TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE</h1>
<p><strong>Chick-fil-A</strong> has been known to donate food in times of disaster recovery but a Texas Chick-fil-A manager took things even a step further when he not only delivered food to a couple stranded on their second floor — but delivered a mode of transportation, as well. Though JC Spencer and his wife Karen weren&#8217;t able to contact first responders for rescue, they were able to get in touch with Chick-fil-A, ordering two grilled chicken burritos (with extra egg), and a boat on the side. The restaurant manager &#8211; the only person able to reach the store at the time, due to flooding — passed on the call to a co-worker, whose husband set out for Spencer&#8217;s house with a fishing boat and two jet-skis in tow. What followed was one of the most remarkable photos published after Hurricane Harvey ravaged Texas (shown above left): Karen on the back of a Jet-ski, in the middle of her living room.</p>

<p>Following the devastating 2010 earthquake in Haiti, Celebrity Chef José Andrés founded <strong>World Central Kitchen</strong> in the hopes that food could serve as an agent of change. Since its inception, the group has implemented culinary training to increase income and create jobs in affected communities in Brazil, Cambodia, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Nicaragua, Zambia, and the United States. Additionally, the organization supports feeding programs that encourage school attendance and provide a source of sustainable revenue for the school.</p>
<p>In August 2017, Cortez, Florida restaurant <strong>The Swordfish Grill</strong> became a makeshift staging area for donated water, food, clothing, diapers, and supplies during Hurricane Harvey relief efforts. The restaurant took to Facebook to post videos and photos of donations (which were then delivered by boat to affected areas), and update followers on the success of the drive.</p>
<h1>THE IMPORTANCE OF A RESTAURANT DISASTER RECOVERY PLAN</h1>
<p>Just as disaster is unavoidable, so is <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-strategic-planning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">having a plan</a>. Without one, operators are playing a risky game, courting disaster with no operating procedures in place. A disaster recovery plan that is properly tested and easily executed is critical for businesses to have in place, no matter the circumstances. At Waffle House, for instance, a number of people and resources are dedicated to hurricane planning, with a leadership team comprised of senior management from each of the company’s functional areas participating in annual preparation meetings as well as on-the-ground response. According to the chain&#8217;s director of purchasing, response processes are well-documented, with a checklist on hand at all locations: &#8220;[Response teams] won’t be lost if they lose the checklist.&#8221;</p>
<p><center></p>
<figure id="attachment_10290" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10290" style="width: 400px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-10290" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Waffle-House-Disaster-Reponse-Menu-e1504727046643.jpg" alt="Waffle House Disaster Reponse Menu" width="400" height="517" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Waffle-House-Disaster-Reponse-Menu-e1504727046643.jpg 400w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Waffle-House-Disaster-Reponse-Menu-e1504727046643-350x452.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-10290" class="wp-caption-text">Waffle House&#8217;s Emergency Menu</figcaption></figure>
<p></center></p>
<p>Even the loss of a single system can send a chain into chaos. Demonstrating confidence — to both staff and to guests — is important, but equally important is the speed at which a restaurant responds to a disaster — both at the unit- and corporate-level. Speed hinges on a plan, of course, so having the tools in place to execute that are tantamount to its success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Menus are one of the most complex aspects of one of the most complex businesses in the world — yet they&#8217;re often relegated to junior teams and mired in committee consensus. Those who&#8217;ve made it past a slump have often done so by launching a new menu that revisits their brand&#8217;s DNA and purpose, in a way that honors the past, but ensures it continues to be relevant today and in the future.</p>
<p><a href="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Pasted_image_at_2018-10-19__4_57_PM.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12644" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Pasted_image_at_2018-10-19__4_57_PM.jpg" alt="Launching a Menu" width="2237" height="1148" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Pasted_image_at_2018-10-19__4_57_PM.jpg 2237w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Pasted_image_at_2018-10-19__4_57_PM-350x180.jpg 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Pasted_image_at_2018-10-19__4_57_PM-300x154-1.jpg 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Pasted_image_at_2018-10-19__4_57_PM-768x394-1.jpg 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Pasted_image_at_2018-10-19__4_57_PM-1024x526-1.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 2237px) 100vw, 2237px" /></a></p>
<p>Below, we outline some of the questions that restaurants launching a new menu should, but often don&#8217;t, consider.</p>
<h2>A Menu is the Single-Most Important Piece of Collateral a Restaurant Has</h2>
<p>For restaurants, a menu is more than a list of entrées, appetizers, and desserts — it’s the company&#8217;s product list and, as such, should serve as its best-performing salesperson. Every restaurant company – from small shops to well-established and multi-national restaurant chains – have pains with rising costs, consistency, profitability, and the need to differentiate their offerings. In large systems, just a few ounces or minutes of waste in a preparation method can lead to tens of millions of dollars in lost profits when extrapolated across the entire system.</p>
<p>Shoddy and anemic analysis &#8211; when it comes to menu design &#8211; can shave millions in profits (unnecessarily). In fact, in our past work, we&#8217;ve consistently been able to add an extra $12,000 for every $1 million in revenue, without changing menu prices or unit costs — just by applying some basic merchandizing techniques. Further considerations regarding menu design include:</p>
<ul>
<li>How might <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/how-to-reduce-restaurant-food-cost" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">food costs</a> be affected by menu changes?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>How will guests <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/the-psychology-of-menu-design" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">psychologically interpret</a> the information included on a menu? How will the design of the menu affect their purchasing behaviors?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Has the architecture of the menu been taken into account? Are merchandising techniques being used to deliberately tap into human biology (i.e. ensure guests&#8217; attention is drawn to items in the way it should be)? Are they overused?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Is the chain considering recent advances in technology, neuromarketing (did you know: FMRIs can scan the brain to see its reaction to information?), heat maps, and eye-tracking software (which offer an inside look at where consumers&#8217; eyes are drawn first), etc.?</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10013" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-08-09-at-5.26.49-PM.png" alt="restaurant heat maps eye tracking" width="2000" height="478" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-08-09-at-5.26.49-PM.png 2000w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-08-09-at-5.26.49-PM-350x84.png 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-08-09-at-5.26.49-PM-300x72.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-08-09-at-5.26.49-PM-768x184.png 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-08-09-at-5.26.49-PM-1024x245.png 1024w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-08-09-at-5.26.49-PM-970x232.png 970w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-08-09-at-5.26.49-PM-500x120.png 500w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-08-09-at-5.26.49-PM-220x53.png 220w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-08-09-at-5.26.49-PM-160x38.png 160w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></p>
<ul>
<li>As consumers look for foods higher in nutritional quality, does the menu communicate a sense of place and sense of season?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Does the menu work within the confines of the lighting and ambiance in the locations themselves? In other words, does it make sense that a restaurant featuring a dark environment also has a menu with small, fine print?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Does the menu properly highlight signature items or the company&#8217;s signature culinary point-of-view?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Does the menu take into account the emergence of new diets, styles of eating, or the rise of food allergies?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Insufficient Approaches are Still Employed by Many Chains</h2>
<p>Current (even antiquated) approaches are still employed by many chains, contributing to further suffering in an industry in which once-major players are already ailing. Even in multi-billion-dollar companies, there will be a well-meaning junior analyst sitting in a cubicle cluttered with competitor menus, punching away in Excel spreadsheets to determine what everyone else is selling and how much they&#8217;re charging for it. Outside the carpeted walls of their cube, however, there are several other areas of a restaurant company (all, in fact) that will be affected by menu changes.</p>
<p>Sending a new menu up the chain to be approved by those in a board room often means only the most bland, consensus-dulled changes will make it through. And the crowded togetherness that often comes in that corporate vacuum can lead to a loss of the company&#8217;s magic, with analysts so closely watching the competition (and therefore straying from their own brand) that they do little to stick out from the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/casual-dining-restaurant-chains-peril-aaron-d-allen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sea of 2-for-$20 menu items</a> so rampant in the industry.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-10041" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Restaurant-Menu-Mistakes.jpg" alt="Launching a New Menu" width="772" height="235" /></p>
<p>While the committee consensus approach can seem to shave off the rough edges, in the process, it could actually remove some of the chain&#8217;s character. Not every chain is going to have advanced analytics in terms of things like eye-tracking software, of course, but even some of the largest, multi-billion-dollar restaurant companies are lagging behind, and could greatly benefit from the application of the latest technology. The following questions help to ensure a company is thinking long-term, and not simply creating a menu in a vacuum:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is every functional area of the business — the operations teams tasked with executing the menu, those in charge of supply chain and distribution, the marketing team, the culinary team — being taken into consideration in the menu design process (before it&#8217;s even been printed)?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Even in smaller chains or independents, have the chef, management, and waitstaff weighed in?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>How does the new menu match up with consumer trends and the company&#8217;s own culinary POV?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Does the new menu resonate with associates, as well as consumers? Does the waitstaff feel a sense of pride in the changes (and, by extension, their workplace)?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Have the cost, distribution, and fulfillment of printing and production been taken into account?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Will there (or should there) be regional differences on menus at various stores? Will the pricing or sourcing and other supply chain considerations be different in various regions?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Specialized Advisory can Move Beyond Incremental Changes</h2>
<p>Firms that utilize new (more advanced) analytics and a holistic approach can ensure the proper analysis required of a new menu undertaking. An agency that specializes in visual design won&#8217;t necessarily understand things like consumer trends, or what makes a drive-thru work (as much more goes into such an important initiative than simply placing items on three menu panels).</p>
<p>A thorough menu engineering and merchandizing strategy engagement will require 3-5 people, working on a full-time equivalency basis for a solid six weeks (if your company is applying less resources than this you may be leaving significant value trapped in an under-performing menu). The design is important, but it requires having the proper bones, structure, and strategy in place first. And it&#8217;s an investment that pays off.<br />

<p>Tremendous things, from revenue bumps to differentiation, earned media, and improved morale, can all be effectuated through the right menu. The effort that should go into launching a new menu is a balancing act. Are there too many (non-owned) logos on the page? Too many menu items all competing with one another? Without strategy, it can become akin to a room full of screaming kids, all vying for the teacher&#8217;s attention. What about photography? In a world full of candid Instagram and Snapchat images, overly-styled images tend to make consumers skeptical. On the one hand, those partner brands can help by conveying a sense of quality and trust. But if overdone, the logo-laden menu can start to look like a NASCAR vehicle. Below are some other, more specialized considerations when undertaking a menu re-design:</p>
<ul>
<li>Has special attention been paid to fonts and typography? How do they affect the menu&#8217;s readability, reflect the brand positioning and brand personality?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>How is photography used? Is it over-used? Are the photos overly-styled, corporate images or more realistic and authentic?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>What about the physicality of menu — is it cumbersome? Can a guest read it and still have a discussion with the other members in their party? How quickly is it likely to become dated, faded, or tattered in real-world operational usage?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>How is iconography (images to denote spicy, gluten-free, vegetarian items) used? Is it over-used?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>How much space do partner brands receive on the menu? If logos of other brands are used, are they used more often than the restaurant&#8217;s itself? Is it diluting the overall messaging?</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Are the adjectives used to describe menu items descriptive or exaggerated? Does the tonality represent the brand&#8217;s point of view in a way that&#8217;s memorable, or does it mirror that of its competitors and sound &#8220;me-too&#8221; to guests and media?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Are items labeled &#8220;wild caught&#8221; or &#8220;sustainable&#8221; or &#8220;free-range&#8221; truly that? Is the menu believable?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Are all menu items easily pronounceable? Will people feel comfortable ordering them?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Have pilots been conducted? If so, has the chain utilized analytics to determine what worked and what didn&#8217;t?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>How will this menu affect packaging, delivery, self-ordering, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/mcdonalds-neglected-drive-thru-starbucks-chick-fil-a-exploited-allen">drive thru</a> or online ordering? Has the proper interface design and programming been achieved (UX/UI is a specialized discipline in and of itself, with very different technical considerations than for printed menus)?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Can food safety protocols and product specifications remain consistent across the full supply chain with the new planned menu changes?</li>
<li>Should the chain implement digital menu boards with narrowcasting abilities, to support automatic menu offering changes depending on daypart, dynamic pricing changes, or other factors?

<ul>
<li>Will the Point-of-Sale system reflect these changes in the right way? If the menu changes at a specific time in the day, does the staff have the right SOP in place to ensure that happens on time?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Keep in mind, some chains have actually started to actively incorporate behavioral economics (a method of economic analysis applying psychological insights into human behavior to explain economic decision-making).</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Importance of Analysis when Launching a New Menu</h2>
<p>If your brand were to speak, how would it walk, talk, act, dress, and behave? Is it playful? Is it serious? The menu should convey that positioning, purpose, and promise. Modern restaurant chains face stiff competition, yet many suffer from the same problems — their menus aren&#8217;t distinct enough, they don&#8217;t mirror the brand&#8217;s personality, and they&#8217;re too long.</p>
<p>We conducted a study of Casual Dining Restaurant menus, and found that many now exceed 4,000 words. With the average person reading about 200 words per minute, it would take them 15+ minutes to read — and that&#8217;s if they were solely concentrating on reading the menu. For such reasons, field observations are also important and can enable greater understanding of how a menu is perceived through the lens of the guest and used in the operation. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10064" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Menu-Read-Time.png" alt="Menu Read Time" width="1072" height="588" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Menu-Read-Time.png 1072w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Menu-Read-Time-350x192.png 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Menu-Read-Time-300x165.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Menu-Read-Time-768x421.png 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Menu-Read-Time-1024x562.png 1024w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Menu-Read-Time-970x532.png 970w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Menu-Read-Time-500x274.png 500w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Menu-Read-Time-220x121.png 220w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Menu-Read-Time-160x88.png 160w" sizes="(max-width: 1072px) 100vw, 1072px" /> Just as it&#8217;s cumbersome to force on the guest too many menu items, its equally cumbersome to be faced with too many syllables (which is often the case when ordering a half-caf, extra-hot, triple-shot White Chocolate Mocha, for instance). Those extra ten syllables to order what is essentially a &#8220;number five&#8221; could be slowing down the drive-thru and translating to millions of dollars lost. With so many moving parts (particularly for those chains with multiple brands operating in more than one region), having the confidence that a new menu will resonate with the guest, the market, and play off the brand&#8217;s promise will ultimately help differentiate a chain and ensure it can remain relevant.</p>
<p>Focusing on just a few key signature items, for instance, can <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/how-to-market-a-restaurant" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">boost revenues</a> for under-performing brands and further propel growth-minded restaurant companies. A lot of discipline is required to get all this right and, to be fair, it&#8217;s a significant undertaking. But when done right, it&#8217;s more than worth it. Increasingly, this marriage of art and science is what&#8217;s required to maintain the level of competitiveness today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Once flush with cash, the oil-rich kingdom of Saudi Arabia is now making several moves to diversify its economy — all part of an effort to combat the budget deficit through cuts to spending and energy subsidies as well as sharp increases in fees and taxes.</p>
<p>In recent trips to Asia and Washington, D.C., Saudi royals have worked to woo global investors emphasize economic diplomacy. In May, when the country hosted U.S. President Donald Trump, it announced a $20 billion investment into infrastructure, most of which would be in the U.S.</p>
<p>Further diversification will come via the hotly anticipated Aramco IPO. As part of the Saudi royal family&#8217;s recently announced Vision 2030 plan, it will sell shares in Aramco, the state oil company, on international markets. In addition, the billionaire Olayan family is also planning a sale of some local assets, which could be worth as much $5 billion on the Tadawul exchange.</p>
<p>The country is making bold moves, but current macroeconomic conditions ensure it won&#8217;t be completely smooth sailing ahead. Below, we examine the challenges and opportunities facing restaurant operators in the KSA in the months ahead:</p>
<h3><strong>THE IMF REVISES GROWTH FORECASTS</strong></h3>
<p>Recently, Saudi has embarked on an ambitious program to reform its economy. In addition to reining in lavish spending, the country is looking for new sources of funds — in the form of a VAT tax and resources from non-oil investments.</p>
<p>Though the International Monetary Fund had previously predicted Saudi&#8217;s GDP growth to be 2%, the IMF revised its forecasts in April, predicting gross domestic product to expand 0.4% in 2017. The revised forecast reflects cuts in government spending, as well as the impact of lower oil production, a downward trend in consumer spend, and an upward adjustment in taxes. The result is that non-oil growth won&#8217;t be as strong as it was during periods of strong oil prices.</p>
<p>The IMF remains upbeat about its forecasts for the region, but has cautioned Saudi against tightening its fiscal policy too fast. In May, the lender said rapid cuts to the government&#8217;s budget deficit could serve to further damage the economy. Riyadh had pledged to eliminate the $79 billion deficit by 2020, undertaking severe austerity measures last year that affected the take-home pay of two-thirds of working Saudi nationals.</p>
<p>The strategy appeared to work, for a time. The deficit shrank 71%, to $6.9 billion in the first quarter of 2017. However, the austerity measures massively slowed growth in the non-oil economy, to nearly zero. In April, after reports of civil unrest, King Salman bin Abdelaziz reversed the contentious austerity measures and reinstated benefits to civil servants and military personnel.</p>

<h3><strong>CONSUMERS ARE STILL CAUTIOUS</strong></h3>
<p>The poor economic conditions of 2016 caused a wariness among Saudi consumers, a trend that was particularly pronounced in the F&amp;B and Restaurant &amp; Hotel sectors. In the first quarter of 2017, however, sales recovered — growing 10% and 15%, respectively.</p>
<div class="infogram-embed" data-id="saudis_are_making_smaller_purchases" data-type="interactive" data-title="SAUDI CONSUMERS ARE MAKING SMALLER PURCHASES"></div>
<p><script>!function(e,t,s,i){var n="InfogramEmbeds",o=e.getElementsByTagName("script"),d=o[0],r=/^http:/.test(e.location)?"http:":"https:";if(/^\/{2}/.test(i)&&(i=r+i),window[n]&&window[n].initialized)window[n].process&&window[n].process();else if(!e.getElementById(s)){var a=e.createElement("script");a.async=1,a.id=s,a.src=i,d.parentNode.insertBefore(a,d)}}(document,0,"infogram-async","//e.infogr.am/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js");</script></p>
<p>Due to the weak economy, sales have plateaued and the average check has decreased sharply. any seem to be eating at home rather than venturing to restaurants, as grocery spend is outpacing restaurant spend. So far in 2017, the average check at restaurants and hotels is 6% lower than the average grocery check.</p>
<p>Stocks didn&#8217;t fare much better. In the first quarter of 2017, no restaurant and consumer stocks saw an increase in price. The Tadawul, however, is at higher levels than it was this time last year (having seen a 25% gain since September 2016) but most of the improvements took place in the final months of 2016.</p>
<div class="infogram-embed" data-id="saudi_stock_exchange" data-type="interactive" data-title="SAUDI HOSPITALITY STOCKS DIDN’T FARE WELL IN Q1 2017"></div>
<p><script>!function(e,t,s,i){var n="InfogramEmbeds",o=e.getElementsByTagName("script"),d=o[0],r=/^http:/.test(e.location)?"http:":"https:";if(/^\/{2}/.test(i)&&(i=r+i),window[n]&&window[n].initialized)window[n].process&&window[n].process();else if(!e.getElementById(s)){var a=e.createElement("script");a.async=1,a.id=s,a.src=i,d.parentNode.insertBefore(a,d)}}(document,0,"infogram-async","//e.infogr.am/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js");</script></p>
<h3><strong>RESTAURANTS HAVE TURNED TO DISCOUNTING</strong></h3>
<p>It appears that some restaurants and hotels have turned to discounting in an effort to combat the slowdown in consumer spend. Since December 2015, Food at Home became 4.6% cheaper in the KSA, while Restaurant and Hotel prices became 1.7% cheaper. Lower prices can also be attributed to a stronger U.S. dollar.</p>
<div class="infogram-embed" data-id="ksa_fah_randh_prices" data-type="interactive" data-title="FOOD AT HOME, RESTAURANTS &amp; HOTELS PRICES HAVE DROPPED"></div>
<p><script>!function(e,t,s,i){var n="InfogramEmbeds",o=e.getElementsByTagName("script"),d=o[0],r=/^http:/.test(e.location)?"http:":"https:";if(/^\/{2}/.test(i)&&(i=r+i),window[n]&&window[n].initialized)window[n].process&&window[n].process();else if(!e.getElementById(s)){var a=e.createElement("script");a.async=1,a.id=s,a.src=i,d.parentNode.insertBefore(a,d)}}(document,0,"infogram-async","//e.infogr.am/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js");</script></p>
<h3><strong>THE IMPACT OF NEW LAWS REMAINS UNCLEAR</strong></h3>
<p>Saudization — the replacement of foreign workers with Saudi nationals in the private sector and the official national policy of the Kingdom — remains a challenge for many businesses in the region, especially those employing low-skilled workers. Overall, nearly 8 in 10 employed workers in the KSA are expats and 85% of those working in low-skilled jobs are expats.</p>
<p>Companies currently pay a levy of SR200 per month per expat employee, but only for those expat employees that exceed the number of Saudi employees. An “expat levy”  (to be phased in by 2020) is expected to raise labor costs for restaurants and hotels, and will bring charges of up to SR800 per worker.</p>
<div class="infogram-embed" data-id="saudization_brings_uncertainty_to_labor_costs" data-type="interactive" data-title="SAUDIZATION BRINGS UNCERTAINTY TO LABOR COSTS"></div>
<p><script>!function(e,t,s,i){var n="InfogramEmbeds",o=e.getElementsByTagName("script"),d=o[0],r=/^http:/.test(e.location)?"http:":"https:";if(/^\/{2}/.test(i)&&(i=r+i),window[n]&&window[n].initialized)window[n].process&&window[n].process();else if(!e.getElementById(s)){var a=e.createElement("script");a.async=1,a.id=s,a.src=i,d.parentNode.insertBefore(a,d)}}(document,0,"infogram-async","//e.infogr.am/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js");</script></p>
<p>Additionally, beginning in March, the country unveiled an amnesty law. The law allows illegal workers to solve their status by approaching the Passport Departments to gain an exemption from the consequences associated with the “deportee fingerprint system” and return to the Kingdom on the condition of pursuing legal methods to gain entry. Amnesty will largely impact low-skilled jobs, like those in the restaurant industry.</p>

<p>Another law expected to directly impact restaurants is the forthcoming soda tax, which aims to curb obesity levels in the kingdom. Saudi Arabia is set to to implement a 50% tax on soft drinks and 100% tax on cigarettes and energy drinks, as of the second quarter of 2017.</p>
<h3><strong>SALARY INCREASES SHOULD HELP BOOST THE ECONOMY</strong></h3>
<p>Interestingly, the impact of lower oil prices and reduced public spend haven&#8217;t been quite as detrimental as many had projected. In fact, most employers are planning for salary increases. A GCC-wide survey of 600 companies found that workers in the Kingdom are expected to get a 4.9% salary increase this year — the highest in the Gulf region.</p>

<h3><strong>THERE REMAINS OPPORTUNITY IN THE TOURISM MARKET</strong></h3>
<p>There&#8217;s been a surge in projects geared toward tourists as of late. There are currently 48 hotel projects underway in Riyadh and 170 hotel projects underway in the KSA, for instance. Still, there&#8217;s room for continued growth in the region&#8217;s tourism sector. Currently, Food and Beverage tourism spend per visitor currently comprises about 14% of the spend in Dubai and 32% that of Abu Dhabi.</p>

<h3><strong>RETAIL CONSTRUCTION CONTINUES TO BOOM</strong></h3>
<p>Saudi&#8217;s retail sector has been a massive success story in the region. Despite the economic downturn, the KSA&#8217;s young population has continued to spend. Add to this the growing population (27 million, 20 million of which are Saudi) and developers continue to see opportunities in the region. So much so, in fact, that in Riyadh, hotel and retail rents are falling due to an increase in the supply of space available for rent.</p>
<div class="infogram-embed" data-id="retail_construction_riyadh" data-type="interactive" data-title="RETAIL CONSTRUCTION ACCELERATING IN RIYADH"></div>

<p>Overall, growth is expected to pick up in 2018. The IMF forecasts Saudi growth to rebound to 2.3% in 2018 — lower than the lender&#8217;s October projection of 2.6%, but still moving in the right direction.</p>

<p><a href="https://aaronallen.com/hotel-food-and-beverage">Hotel F&amp;B</a> is being reshaped by powerful forces. In 2016 alone, 18% of business travelers used Airbnb — a number that’s expected to rise to 23% in 2017.&nbsp; With the sharing economy so dramatically altering the industry, being on the cusp of trends (and offering amenities that a rented house or apartment can’t) is crucial.</p>



<p>Food and beverage revenue is growing in importance to overall hotel profitability, a break from times past when it was considered a loss leader. But the average hotel doesn’t pay much attention to cutting-edge trends in either in-room or on-site dining. Most can do a better job of feeding both guests and the bottom line.</p>



<p>Some savvy companies are responding — though, similar to <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-recession-2017">some pockets of the restaurant world</a>, many seem to be lagging behind. The companies that can focus on improving common problem areas, like those below, will be light years ahead of the game. But those who can take it a step further — implementing tech, mirroring the trends seen throughout the restaurant industry at large — will lead the pack.</p>



<p>Below, some of the most common hotel food and beverage mistakes.</p>



<h2 id="h-1-no-sense-of-season-or-sense-of-place-for-hotel-food-beverage">1. NO SENSE OF SEASON OR SENSE OF PLACE FOR HOTEL FOOD &amp; BEVERAGE</h2>



<p>The local, seasonal movement took off in the restaurant world some time ago; a full 21% of U.S. diners now say they are willing to pay more for local food and drinks, and 41% of consumers say “locally-sourced ingredients” influence their dining choices. Plus, one of the best parts of traveling to a new city is experiencing the regional cuisine. Still, many hotel F&amp;B concepts lack a sense of local flavor — failing to offer items that are unique to the location or relevant to the season.</p>



<p>Eighty percent of restaurant operators say that guests are interested in locally sourced items, so capitalizing on that trend is an easy win. Labeling the local suppliers on the menu is an excellent way to convey a commitment to local food traditions; so is showcasing those notable local items: biryanis, lumpia, croissant, deep-dish pizzas or regional barbecue, artisan cheeses.</p>



<p>And don’t forget the locally roasted coffees, craft beers, ciders and wines. Look at any list of “best bars” and you’ll find themes: an outrageous selection of tequilas, bourbons or vodkas, beer cocktails, barrel-aged cocktails, pre-Prohibition recipes, whiskey tastings, wine flights. A hotel bar can compete by picking a theme and owning it, especially if it’s one that will resonate with its audience.</p>



<p>Even culinary and cultural traditions — like an English tea service, the famous Peabody ducks, Arabic coffee service — convey a sense of regional pride and uniqueness that guests aren’t likely to find elsewhere.</p>



<h2 id="h-2-few-or-poor-hotel-food-and-beverage-options-for-guests-on-special-diets">2. FEW OR POOR HOTEL FOOD AND BEVERAGE OPTIONS FOR GUESTS ON SPECIAL DIETS</h2>



<p>Eating with some type of food restriction is quickly becoming the norm, with more consumers identifying themselves by their food preferences: paleo, gluten-free, low-carb, vegetarian, organic, raw, nut allergies, and so on. Food allergies affect more than 15 million Americans alone — and even those without allergies are eating in new ways. In 2014, “gluten-free diet” was the third top diet search on Google, just behind Paleo and Atkins.</p>



<p>It’s difficult to make everyone happy, but the typical restaurant customer today is accustomed to choices. If a menu doesn’t address at least some of those preferences, it’s likely to turn diners off and seem dated.</p>



<p>And it’s not enough simply to add dishes that appeal to these groups. They need to be clearly but subtly labeled. If the kitchen is willing to adapt dishes to accommodate diners (which should be a given in this day and age), the menu should make note of that.</p>



<p>Some hotel chains have gotten this right in recent years. Sheraton’s Color Your Plate campaign encouraged guests to add three colors from fruit and vegetables to their plate, to help increase energy (and keep in shape) while traveling. The program educated Sheraton guests about the importance of a healthy lifestyle and included menu items with that represented an ideal dietary balance.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotel-food-and-beverage-examples-sheraton.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="627" height="941" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotel-food-and-beverage-examples-sheraton.jpg" alt="Sheraton Color Your Plate Program" class="wp-image-16816" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotel-food-and-beverage-examples-sheraton.jpg 627w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotel-food-and-beverage-examples-sheraton-350x525.jpg 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotel-food-and-beverage-examples-sheraton-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 627px) 100vw, 627px" /></a></figure></div>



<h2 id="h-3-hotel-f-b-mistake-no-wi-fi">3. HOTEL F&amp;B MISTAKE: NO WI-FI</h2>



<p>A recent Cornell study found that free in-room Wi-Fi is the one of the top five factors travelers considered when choosing a hotel. Patrons, particularly if they are dining alone or away from home as is most likely the case in a hotel restaurant, want to use their phones, laptops and tablets to get work done, clear out their inboxes, or catch up with friends and family. Wi-Fi is no longer a “nice to have,” it’s a must. And while this may seem obvious, there are still many hotels that don’t offer free, in-room or on-property Wi-Fi.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotel-food-and-beverage-mistakes-no-wifi.png"><img loading="lazy" width="988" height="172" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotel-food-and-beverage-mistakes-no-wifi.png" alt="Hotel Food and Beverage Wifi" class="wp-image-16817" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotel-food-and-beverage-mistakes-no-wifi.png 988w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotel-food-and-beverage-mistakes-no-wifi-350x61.png 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotel-food-and-beverage-mistakes-no-wifi-300x52.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotel-food-and-beverage-mistakes-no-wifi-768x134.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 988px) 100vw, 988px" /></a></figure></div>



<p>In fact, many chains are aiming to go above and beyond in-room wi-fi, testing voice-activated technology that will allow guests to turn on lights, change television channels, and perhaps even place an order for room service. With 20% of search queries on Google’s mobile app and on Android devises now comprised of voice searches, it’s a smart move for companies to be on the forefront.</p>



<p>Marriott International is testing both Amazon’s Alexa-powered Echo device, as well as Apple’s Siri, while Wynn Resorts became the first hotel chain to install in-room Echos in December. In Las Vegas’ Cosmopolitan, guests can text with Rose, a chatbot who can offer cocktail recommendations or describe the ambience at local restaurants.</p>



<h2 id="h-4-a-static-hotel-f-b-menu">4. A STATIC HOTEL F&amp;B MENU</h2>



<p>With so many off-property options competing for guests’ food dollars, on-site restaurants can’t afford to stagnate. Yet so many menus give the impression that the chef hasn’t learned any new tricks in a decade or two. That’s a recipe for irrelevance.</p>



<p>A restaurant in a trendy, stylish hotel needs to offer equally relevant cuisine, not just “me-too” fare. But even a restaurant in a mass-market hotel can show signs of life by staying on top of food fads as they move into the mainstream—offering alternatives to dairy milk, varied protein portion options, more superfoods, gluten-free dishes, craft beers, handcrafted cocktails, and small plates.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotel-food-and-beverage-trends.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="984" height="996" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotel-food-and-beverage-trends.jpg" alt="Hotel Mulia Jakarta, Indonesia Hotel Food and Beverage" class="wp-image-16818" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotel-food-and-beverage-trends.jpg 984w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotel-food-and-beverage-trends-100x100.jpg 100w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotel-food-and-beverage-trends-350x354.jpg 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotel-food-and-beverage-trends-296x300.jpg 296w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotel-food-and-beverage-trends-768x777.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 984px) 100vw, 984px" /></a></figure></div>



<p>There are a select few who have responded to culinary trends. The Four Seasons Hotel in Chicago has an on-site mixologist who can be summoned to guest rooms to craft a cocktail to their liking. For those interested in something sweeter, the hotel also offers an ice cream man that will make sundaes to order. The Soho House chain of hotels provides a similar offer — a bartender who pushes a cocktail cart nightly to make pre-dinner drinks.</p>



<h2 id="h-5-poorly-designed-overpriced-room-service">5. POORLY DESIGNED, OVERPRICED ROOM SERVICE</h2>



<p>Thumb through the average room service menu and you’re likely to find the usual timeworn suspects — the club sandwich, the burger, the overpriced breakfast, lots of booze — along with premium prices and, to top it off, a usually hefty service charge. When it comes to pricing, it seems there’s no rhyme or reason to what a hotel will charge. Data from TripAdvisor found that room service costs vary wildly throughout the country. In New York City, a club sandwich costs $24.20, while in Denver, just $11.70. The average bottle of water in Los Angeles is an astounding $6.80, while a pack of peanuts in Boston will set hotel guests back some $13. It’s probably unsurprising, then, that nearly 40% of travelers in 2014 said they’d ordered room service while only 13% had visited the mini bar.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/food-and-beverage-in-hotel-industry.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="982" height="814" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/food-and-beverage-in-hotel-industry.jpg" alt="Hotel Room Service Water" class="wp-image-16819" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/food-and-beverage-in-hotel-industry.jpg 982w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/food-and-beverage-in-hotel-industry-350x290.jpg 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/food-and-beverage-in-hotel-industry-300x249.jpg 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/food-and-beverage-in-hotel-industry-768x637.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 982px) 100vw, 982px" /></a></figure></div>



<p>Not only do prices vary widely from city to city, but they can occasionally vacillate within the hotel itself. Often, a hotel’s room service menu features many of the same items as the hotel restaurant — albeit at much higher prices. While of course hotel operators see the upside — upping prices can positively impact the bottom line — it may actually be doing more harm than good in terms of profitability, because guests feel cheated. Plus, this detracts from not just hotel food and beverage, but the overall guest experience and perception of the hotel brand.</p>



<p>A hotel that can produce a high-quality, thoughtful menu at a price point that matches the situation is bound to score with guests. A hotel that fails to do that is increasingly likely to find takeout containers piled high in guestroom trash cans.</p>



<h2 id="h-6-low-tech-room-service">6. LOW-TECH ROOM SERVICE</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotel-guest-experience.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="986" height="720" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotel-guest-experience.jpg" alt="Marriott CIO and Mobile Apps" class="wp-image-16821" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotel-guest-experience.jpg 986w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotel-guest-experience-350x256.jpg 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotel-guest-experience-300x219.jpg 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotel-guest-experience-768x561.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 986px) 100vw, 986px" /></a></figure></div>



<p>The process of ordering room service in a hotel is, for 2017, rather antiquated. In the world of delivery, picking up the phone to place an order is old-school — today, many of us just use an app or order online. Some 34% of consumers say technology makes them opt for takeout or delivery more often, which is one of the many reasons standalone restaurants are investing in digital marketing and online ordering capabilities.</p>



<p>Hotels should take cues from the world outside their walls — in-house apps with the room service menu pre-programmed would be much more seamless for guests and employees, as it cuts down on the number of wrong orders. Plus, studies have found that guests tend to order more food (and therefore spend more) when they use an online system versus the telephone.</p>



<p>In 2016, Marriott announced it would begin rolling out a slew of new tech-friendly options for guests (including room service-via-app). According to CIO Bruce Hoffmeister, mobile revenue was up at the company 25% year-over-year, from 2014 to 2015, with 75% off all guests using Marriott.com to gather information about their stay. Even the iconic Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel is staying on the cusp of technology, using the ALICE software module to optimize staff communication and increase guest satisfaction. Once a guest request is entered into ALICE (complete with the guest&#8217;s location), the staff member in closest proximity can address the issue and easily let his colleagues know he&#8217;s done so.</p>



<h2 id="h-7-little-hotel-f-b-marketing-either-on-property-or-off-and-a-lackluster-if-any-website">7. LITTLE HOTEL F&amp;B MARKETING, EITHER ON-PROPERTY OR OFF, AND A LACKLUSTER (IF ANY) WEBSITE</h2>



<p>Many hotel managers seem to think that mounting small posters in the elevators is sufficient to fill seats in the restaurant. Sure, there’s a captive audience looking for something to focus on during the ride up and down. Maybe these passive reminders will reel in a few guests. Same with in-room table tents on the guestroom desk, a description in the hotel directory, or a video on the hotel TV channel.</p>



<p>Most hotel F&amp;B websites are, at best, woefully dated. At worst, they don’t have an online presence at all, making it difficult for guests to even encounter the on-site restaurant while searching for nearby restaurants on their phones or computers. With 70% of smartphone users viewing restaurant menus on their phones, it’s increasingly imperative to have an online presence (ideally one that updates consumers on new menu items).</p>



<p>But few hotel restaurants can turn a profit from in-house traffic alone. Visitors are there a few days or a few times during the year. Locals could choose a reservation any time. Capturing the attention of locals creates more energy for a restaurant and potentially more frequent visits. An organized marketing effort to inspire a buzz among locals is a must.</p>



<h2 id="h-8-a-hidden-location-and-impossible-to-find-hours-of-operation">8. A HIDDEN LOCATION (AND IMPOSSIBLE-TO-FIND HOURS OF OPERATION)</h2>



<p>Many hotel chains view hotel F&amp;B as a loss-leading amenity and, therefore, don’t put much effort toward it. In some cases, on-site hotel restaurants are nearly impossible to find, and put little to no effort into geo-search marketing, so guests aren’t even aware of what’s just downstairs in the lobby.</p>



<p>There’s no point in keeping a restaurant a secret, making it difficult to find or enclosing it; on the other hand, an open-design space that’s visible from the lobby, particularly if it’s busy, will feed business.</p>



<p>All too often, hotel restaurants and room service fail to make their hours available online or in the room. Even when they do, they’re often listed inaccurately. A common mistake restaurateurs (both in and out of the hotel F&amp;B industry) make is accidentally creating the appearance that their restaurant is closed when it is not. Restaurants should be convenient and welcoming, to attract as many guests as possible.</p>



<h2 id="h-9-poor-execution-overcooked-food">9. POOR EXECUTION &amp; OVERCOOKED FOOD</h2>



<p>If it can’t be executed, don’t attempt it. That goes for you, $40 hotel room rib-eye. High cost menu items that aren’t even appropriately prepared will are not only expensive, they’re tasteless. Guests ordering a $20 glass of House Wine will be even more discouraged when they’re served a 5-ounce pour of Robert Mondavi. Do it well, or don’t do it at all.</p>



<p>Many hotels fail to execute a timely dining experience — which can be both a nuisance for guests and do a disservice to the meal itself. A greater emphasis on having food delivered in a timely manner (rather than taking 45 minutes to an hour for an order of scrambled eggs) would certainly resonate with guests. Plus, it would ensure the food doesn’t fall victim to steam, from being transported under covers.</p>



<p>When room service so often arriving cold or overcooked, it’s no wonder that some guests order takeout from the restaurant downstairs (best case scenario) or call-in for delivery. And these days, it’s much easier to get more than just pizza delivered to a hotel room from an outside restaurant.</p>



<p>A 12<sup>th</sup>-floor room service order for a medium-rare steak requires a different preparation than a traditional restaurant order for a medium-rare. If the hotel kitchen cooks a steak to medium-rare, it will likely be well past that by the time it arrives to room 1207, especially if its placed beneath a cloche or in a hot box for transport. Slightly undercooking meat — knowing that it will continue cooking on the ride up to the guest — isn’t necessarily something a line cook would know. Unless, of course, that education is built into a hotel F&amp;B training program, to help address the problem at its root.</p>

<h2 id="h-10-slow-service">10. SLOW SERVICE</h2>



<p>Vacationing guests have plenty of time to linger over a leisurely brunch, but business travelers and local office folks having lunch are most likely strapped for time. Offering fixed-price meals or scaled-down quick menu options is one way to manage this issue.</p>



<p>And while the ordering and preparation process can take 45 minutes or longer, even worse is the set-up: The wheeling in of food, an attempt to set the meal wherever there’s room, and a dramatic unveiling of each item can add to the process.</p>



<h2 id="h-11-someone-calling-the-room-just-to-check-in">11. SOMEONE CALLING THE ROOM, JUST TO CHECK IN</h2>



<p>Reading the table — or, in the case of hotel F&amp;B, the room — is important. Busy or weary travelers who are enjoying room service probably don’t need to be interrupted by someone circling back with them and calling their room, just to check in. Phone calls — which almost inevitably seem to coincide with the first bite of food — are often incredibly interruptive. Hotels might now be conditioned to think this ‘service” is elevating the guest experience but to most travelers, it’s a huge inconvenience. They just want the food. If a guest needs anything additional, they’ll call.</p>



<h2 id="h-12-ignoring-snacks">12. IGNORING SNACKS</h2>



<p>Guests who arrive at a hotel after the dinner hour could have been traveling all day and want something to eat, but not a full meal. And Americans are replacing meals with snacks more frequently (just one of the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/2017-restaurant-industry-predictions-aaron-d-allen">restaurant trends</a> we predict will crop up more and more in 2017). In fact, recent data suggests that 94% of Americans snack at least once a day. Fifty percent of Americans snack two or three times a day.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotel-FB-stats.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="341" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotel-FB-stats.jpg" alt="Americans Snacking Habits" class="wp-image-16822" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotel-FB-stats.jpg 1024w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotel-FB-stats-350x117.jpg 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotel-FB-stats-300x100.jpg 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hotel-FB-stats-768x256.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>



<p>An on-property restaurant not prepared to handle those cravings — either through room service, a robust bar snack menu or a retail offering — is not providing a hospitable experience and forgoing an opportunity to capture the attention of guests. But that doesn’t necessarily mean guests will reach for that $6 can of Pringles in the hotel mini-bar: Despite 94% of Americans snacking daily, only 13% say they visit the hotel mini-bar for a snack. Culinary trends like small plates and tapas (which fall in line with a greater occurrence of snacking) haven’t quite made their way to hotel room service menus — and could provide a great opportunity.</p>



<p>In other words, snacking is a culinary trend (one of many) that hotels aren’t tapping into. Anticipating a guests’ needs is something hotels do so well: providing toothbrushes or toiletries to those who need it, for example. Yet when it comes to dining, few are anticipating guest needs or trends from a culinary perspective.</p>



<h2 id="h-13-f-b-positioning-out-of-step-with-the-hotel">13. F&amp;B POSITIONING OUT OF STEP WITH THE HOTEL</h2>



<p>Hotels large enough to support multiple dining outlets tend to take a shotgun approach to dining, creating spaces and menus for every taste and budget. But most hotels don’t have that latitude. They might have one or two chances to get it right. That means a dining experience that reflects what’s going on elsewhere on the property. Sometimes an upgrade in one part of a hotel (guestrooms) leaves the other part (dining areas) in the dust.</p>



<p>A modern, sleek and mid-priced suburban hotel, then, probably isn’t the best place for a dark, high-end steakhouse or a nostalgic diner. Clients of a classic hotel probably won’t support a casual burger place or a sports bar. And so forth. The tone should be consistent.</p>



<h2 id="h-14-failing-to-ward-against-the-competition">14. FAILING TO WARD AGAINST THE COMPETITION</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="1024" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Hotel-Brochures-1024x1024.jpg" alt="Hotel Brochures" class="wp-image-9709" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Hotel-Brochures-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Hotel-Brochures-250x250.jpg 250w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Hotel-Brochures-100x100.jpg 100w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Hotel-Brochures-350x350.jpg 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Hotel-Brochures-150x150.jpg 150w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Hotel-Brochures-300x300.jpg 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Hotel-Brochures-768x768.jpg 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Hotel-Brochures-54x54.jpg 54w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Hotel-Brochures-970x970.jpg 970w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Hotel-Brochures-500x500.jpg 500w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Hotel-Brochures-124x124.jpg 124w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Hotel-Brochures-90x90.jpg 90w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Hotel-Brochures.jpg 1421w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Who among us hasn’t walked into their hotel room and had to immediately navigate a pile fliers for nearby pizza parlors and other delivery options? These days, paper fliers are pretty antiquated — it’s easy enough to log on to GrubHub or UberEats and get delivery to your hotel room — and yet they all still seem to make their way to hotel rooms. What’s worse is that hotels aren’t doing much (if anything) about it.</p>



<p>Hotels should have control over who walks onto their property, and certainly who goes door-to-door in their hotel. A standalone restaurant wouldn’t allow a competitor to go table-to-table, luring diners away with discounts or delivery options. Likewise, hotels could pretty easily prevent the competition from advertising directly to guests.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-opportunities-are-plentiful">THE OPPORTUNITIES ARE PLENTIFUL</h3>



<p>Historically, hotels haven’t been on the cutting edge of dining options — which means there’s much opportunity in a largely untapped space. To do it successfully, though, will require evaluating the entire dining interaction, which goes much deeper than just placing an order and eating food. Everything from guest greeting to bill request and even post-purchase behavior (i.e. where a guest goes once leaving the venue) can help determine the outcome of the overall dining experience.</p>



<p>We’ve helped some of the world’s largest hotel chains strengthen their F&amp;B, so we know firsthand that those industry players who can make moves away from the traditional sub-par in-room or on-site dining experience — and take a page from the traditional restaurant industry — will woo guests and locals alike.</p>



<p>In order to remain competitive, hotels must incorporate the latest technologies (and take into account evolving dining habits) into their F&amp;B programs and marketing strategies. Because few have been innovative when it comes to the food and beverage offerings at hotels, there’s a unique opportunity for operators to set the benchmark — and carve out a niche in an industry that sorely needs one.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The would-be U.S. Secretary of Labor can’t wait to see you replaced with a robot.</p>
<p>Who could blame him? He has several good points.</p>
<p>Robots never call in sick. They never complain. They work 24/7 for pennies on the dollar. They’re as eager to please as any programmer can dream up and they think as fast as a calculator (and hardly muse it as a miracle when they do). Science Fiction has long warned that robot overlords are in the future anyway. So, why not use them to replace one of the largest, most under-skilled, under-motivated, and difficult-to-deal with swaths of the workforce, all while simultaneously reducing costs and heralding in the next industrial revolution — one that’s as good for society as it is for shareholders?</p>
<p>Robots and automation make a lot of sense for restaurants, an industry filled with players who are struggling to remain relevant and find themselves bogged down by high labor costs. Certain facets — like healthcare and the automotive industry — have been utilizing robotic automation for decades, to great success. The restaurant industry has been slower to get on board but, steadily, we’ve begun to welcome our robot overlords, too (or, at least, our robot co-workers). But will restaurant robots replace workers?</p>
<p>The one constant in life, and in business, is change. Restaurant operators are finding themselves at a fork in the road: bring technology into the business or have technology thrust on them.</p>
<p>Automation has generated enormous hype for its potential to transform every facet of the restaurant business. We aren’t quite there yet, but several chains are making strides.</p>
<h2>Automation Could Save Quick Service Restaurants $12.2 Billion in Annual Wages in the U.S. Alone</h2>
<p><a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-robotics">Restaurant robotics</a> helps reduce redundancies and inefficiencies that undermine productivity and profitability. A National Robotics Education Foundation study found that the average QSR establishment can shift 1.2 workers from counter service to other tasks as remote order taking and other functions are taken over by robotic applications. That switch equates to an approximate savings of $12.2 billion in annual wages across the U.S. This figure would be slightly offset by the investment in robotic technology up front (assuming 600,000 kiosks require an average investment of $10,000 each), but the total net savings still would exceed $6 billion in just the first year.</p>
<p>Tech&#8217;s powerful impact on cost and productivity is already clear in other industries. Innovations like the cotton gin and the tractor not only made agricultural work easier, but also increased productivity. A similar spike in productivity occurred shortly after GMOs were cultivated worldwide. The past five decades alone have seen a tremendous productivity spike: one worker in 2014 produced the same tonnage of produce as nearly six workers in the 1960s.</p>

<h2>Some Restaurant Chains are Already Reaping the Benefits of Automation</h2>
<p>McDonald’s is rolling out digital self-order kiosks in all of its 14,000 U.S. stores. Wendy’s is making kiosks available to franchisees across its 6,000-plus units. At Panera, the use of kiosks has <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-tech-investment">shaved lifetimes off of customer waits</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-9562 size-full aligncenter" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/LSRQSR-kiosks.jpg" alt="restaurant robots replace workers at QSR and LSR formats" width="637" height="183" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/LSRQSR-kiosks.jpg 637w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/LSRQSR-kiosks-350x101.jpg 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/LSRQSR-kiosks-300x86.jpg 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/LSRQSR-kiosks-500x144.jpg 500w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/LSRQSR-kiosks-220x63.jpg 220w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/LSRQSR-kiosks-160x46.jpg 160w" sizes="(max-width: 637px) 100vw, 637px" /></p>
<p>Eatsa, launched in 2015, relies solely on kiosks in lieu of front-of-house staff. Customers at eatsa never interact with a human employee, although unseen humans in the back of house prepare the food. According to the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/09/upshot/restaurant-of-the-future-service-with-an-impersonal-touch.html?_r=0">New York Times</a>, “there are plans to fully automate that process, too, if it can be done less expensively than employing people.”</p>
<p>And then there are the chef-bots: robots that can assemble a pizza and pile toppings on a sandwich. The burger-flipping robots designed by Momentum Machines can produce 360 burgers per hour, even custom-grinding meat to order. Also, because they’re robots, they don’t carry the risk of norovirus.</p>
<p>The widespread use of burger bots certainly won’t come overnight, though similar devices have already shown great potential. At Silicon Valley’s Zume Pizza, pies laden with hand-cured pepperoni, cheese, and organic veggies are assembled by both humans and robots, then baked in an automated oven or a van on their way to be delivered.</p>
<h2>Consumers are Growing More Comfortable with Tech</h2>
<p>Consumers are interested in where their food comes from, but maybe not quite ready to shake the hand of the robot baking it. That attitude is changing pretty rapidly, though.</p>
<h3><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9639" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/McDonalds-line-wait-time-automation.jpg" alt="McDonald's line wait time automation" width="587" height="197" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/McDonalds-line-wait-time-automation.jpg 587w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/McDonalds-line-wait-time-automation-350x117.jpg 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/McDonalds-line-wait-time-automation-300x101.jpg 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/McDonalds-line-wait-time-automation-500x168.jpg 500w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/McDonalds-line-wait-time-automation-220x74.jpg 220w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/McDonalds-line-wait-time-automation-160x54.jpg 160w" sizes="(max-width: 587px) 100vw, 587px" /></h3>
<p>In some cases, guests say they would rather use tech if it would save them a few minutes of standing in line. According to a study conducted by Tillster (the company behind both Burger King and Taco Bell&#8217;s apps), fast food customers spend about one-third of their visit just waiting for food. But only 36 percent of them say they would wait in a line at counter longer than five people. The other 64 percent would simply leave — unless the restaurant offered a kiosk, in which case respondents said they’d opt for that over a human worker.</p>
<p>Let’s dig a bit deeper into that. The average fast-food transaction lasts 3 minutes and 23 seconds, one-third of which (1:07) is spent waiting for food. If a self-order kiosk could reduce wait time by just 15% (some companies claim time-savings of double that), this would save up to 10 seconds per transaction. For McDonald’s 14,000 U.S. locations, that equates to more than 13.6 million hours saved in the first year of kiosks being installed system-wide.</p>
<p>Robots and self-serve kiosks tend to be more efficient, and better at upselling, than a human worker. People also tend to order more food from kiosks and apps than they would from a human. Orders made via Taco Bell&#8217;s digital app, for instance, are 20 percent higher than those taken by human cashiers.</p>
<p><a href="https://aaronallen.com/restaurant-technology">Restaurant technology</a> can also tailor an experience to a particular guest or scenario. McDonald’s digital menu boards, for example, highlight breakfast items in the morning, and can even change based on rain or a cold snap.</p>
<h2>Technology&#8217;s Positive Impact Extends Beyond the Front of House</h2>
<p>The dialogue around automation has focused primarily on consumer-facing technology. But the benefits go beyond flashy, Jetsons-style robots. Automation will eventually give operators new ways to control and optimize every functional area of their operation.</p>
<p>Software companies are continuously expanding their platforms to be a single point for unit-level managers and workers alike. Today, systems like HotSchedules allow employees to alter their schedules, make changes to their shifts, and communicate with managers and co-workers. When I Work, for instance, has generated $24 million in funding so far. By enabling more efficient scheduling, they keep employees happy and create labor savings.</p>
<p>New tools in the pipeline aim to help restaurants make more informed decisions when determining supply chain sales. BlueCart, which has raised $4 million in funding, helps restaurants track their inventory and aggregate supplier orders.</p>
<p>Burgeoning technologies also have the capacity to streamline hiring, restaurant real estate processes, inventory, and food preparation. A number of startups have developed digital platforms for restaurant marketing (Upserve, Fishbowl); customer loyalty (FiveStars, Belly); and even wi-wi (WiWide in China allows restaurants to analyze customer behavior by tracking who’s logging on and off).</p>
<p>Analytics companies are also proving integral to chains, providing restaurant operators up-to-date benchmarks to competitors. Wherever man-hours can be reduced (or replaced) by automation, technology will find a way.</p>
<h2>The Reward Outweighs the Risk</h2>
<p>Technology does not often come cheaply, especially when it’s new. The good news is that new and more affordable systems are beginning to reach market maturity. Zume Pizzeria’s robots cost $3 million to develop, and company executives say new locations cost $750,000 &#8211; $1 million to launch. Once fully automated, the restaurant predicts its labor costs will be 14 percent of revenue, about half that of the competition.</p>

<p>At Domino’s, a new location costs just $250,000 to $300,000 to launch. Pizza-making robots might not make much financial sense, but the Zume model of a pizza that bakes in an oven while en route to be delivered? Domino’s is already testing it.</p>
<p>Technology is a rising tide, but that doesn’t mean it will lift the boat of those who are floundering. For chains that want to ensure relevance, shave dollars off labor costs, and create a dynamic experience in both the front and back-of-house, automation has proved more than compelling. The chains who are early to adopt the latest advances are the ones who will reap the largest benefits.</p>
<h2>The Human Touch is Still an Integral Part of the Industry</h2>
<p>If you can’t deliver an experience and skill that a robot can, well, you might have to step aside and reward robots that can do better. (In other words: If you don’t have more charisma than IBM&#8217;s Watson, well, you might be in danger of losing your job.)</p>
<p>Those workers who are likely to be replaced will need to enhance their skills to focus on the valuable things a robot can’t do yet — things like critical thinking, expressing empathy, and adding a human touch to hospitality; while also embracing a world and workplace co-inhabited with robots, artificial intelligence, and the implications that come along with the Internet of Things (IoT).</p>
<p>Tiptoeing around the fringes is no longer an option, especially if a brand wants to ensure relevance. Due to the fast pace of technology, restaurant chains must learn to deal with the specifics of today, and adapt to a quickly changing environment moving forward. It&#8217;s therefore incumbent upon companies to invest resources (both human and financial) toward adding a new pace and dynamic into their business. In a risk-averse, slow-moving industry like the restaurant business, technology adds that new dynamic.</p>
<p>A robot will never have a human heart. It will never have a more authentic and genuine passion than its programmer dictated it should; and therefore its response may never truly be that much better than that of a well-mannered automated phone system. That&#8217;s why you can still find jobs, and humans still work better than robots.</p>
<p>But building an incredible business isn’t only about how much additional margin can be squeezed and how systematized the automation can be. It’s also about how human a company can be — how it can relate to and empathize with employees and guests on not only a rational level, but in a caring and compassionate way. While a robot’s “brain” might work faster than a human’s, it’s the human touch that makes for a better corporate strategy, and also a better society.</p>
