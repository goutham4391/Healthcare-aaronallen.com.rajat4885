<p>Running a restaurant is hard work. There are so many things to think about — from inventory management to restaurant payment and billing and more — it can be difficult to keep track of it all. That&#8217;s where restaurant management software comes in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this roundup, we will take a look at some of the best restaurant management software out there. We&#8217;ll explore software for inventory management, restaurant payment and billing, food delivery, dashboards, restaurant onboarding, reservation management, and ERP systems. So whether you&#8217;re just starting out or you&#8217;ve been in the business for years, here&#8217;s the software that will help you increase productivity in your restaurant. </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-21058 size-full" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Restaurant-Management-Software.jpg" alt="" width="1416" height="494" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Restaurant-Management-Software.jpg 1416w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Restaurant-Management-Software-300x105.jpg 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Restaurant-Management-Software-1024x357.jpg 1024w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Restaurant-Management-Software-768x268.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1416px) 100vw, 1416px" /></p>
<p>Some of the most popular <a href="https://www.g2.com/categories/restaurant-management">restaurant management software</a> include tools and features across at least four or five of the following categories:</p>
<h2>Restaurant Point of Sale</h2>
<p>The point of sale system is the nervous system for the <a href="https://aaronallen.com/restaurant-technology">restaurant tech stack</a>. It tracks all the transactions with a great level of detail (from the date and time to what items were purchased to returns or void checks, to how it was paid, who sold it, and what table were people seating in for casual dining restaurants). The POS simplifies record keeping and cash flow accountability as well as operations by sending the orders to the kitchen directly. The best restaurant POS systems also come with features like inventory management, customer relationship management (CRM), <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/menu-strategy">menu management</a>, and omnichannel ordering capabilities.<br /><br />There is a difference between popular POS systems like Toast, Square, TouchBistro and Upserve that are most suited for independents and small chains, and enterprise-level POS like Brink, NCR, Oracle MICROS (legacy systems), Qu Beyond POS, and Revel, among others. <br /><br /></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<h2>Restaurant Inventory Management</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inventory-management.asp">Inventory management</a> is one of the most important, but challenging, aspects of running a food service business. The cost of goods sold (COGS) has a significant impact on profitability, so it’s critical to get inventory levels right. Perishable items, seasonal changes, food inflation, and availability can affect the menu. The goal of any inventory management system is to make sure that the right items are ordered at the right time.<br /><br />Automated systems will often integrate with your POS system to keep track of stocks and even order new supplies automatically. Some examples of restaurant inventory management software are: MarketMan, Orderly, Partender, Crunchtime, Restaurant365, Fourth, MarginEdge, and BevSpot.</p>
<h2>Restaurant Labor Management</h2>
<p>With labor costs claiming around <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-profit-and-loss">30% of sales in cost</a>, labor management software has key importance for efficiencies. This software allows organizing the workforce schedule. It also enables real-time tracking of employee performance and managing payroll processes. The best restaurant labor management software systems will have features like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time clock functionality to track employee hours</li>
<li>Ability to manage tips</li>
<li>Scheduling features</li>
<li>Tracking employee performance</li>
<li>Payroll management </li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the software options in this category include 7Shifts, Fourth, Jolt, Push Operations, and Sling.<br /><br />Some of the platforms that can help with recruiting and retention are CultureAmp (a platform to improve employee engagement and performance, used by McDonald&#8217;s), BambooHR (HR software to be used from hiring to onboarding to building culture), and Applauz (Software built for engaging, recognizing, and rewarding).</p>
<h2>Restaurant Repairs &amp; Maintenance Software</h2>
<p>Facility Management can be a time consuming task when trying to keep lists of equipment and infrastructure to repair. One option is to have a CMMS (Computerized Maintenance Management System) but currently, platforms can go one step further by linking smart equipment and using computer vision to check equipment. <br /><br />One example of R&amp;M software is Trustplace, which allows companies to have lists digitized on the maintenance side. It enables team members to take photos with an iPad and make notes on the problem. This helps keep everybody honest as there is clear documentation, which is then managed (and can allow managers to request budget authorization as well). </p>
<h2>Restaurant Dashboards &amp; Reporting</h2>
<p>Restaurant executives are time-deprived. Historically, many decisions are made with past data when what’s needed are fast corrections in real time. The best dashboard, analytics, and reporting software enable a get-it-at-a-glance of the system, with the ability to drill down to the store, functional area, employee, and transaction level. It needs to be linked to the other systems to pull the information in a centralized way. <br /><br />Rather than having multiple channels evaluated separately, leveraging a platform to integrate sales, labor costs, menu item margins, top-selling items, beverage mix, food cost, etc. can help to optimize performance. Some examples of software helping to do this are Olo, Chowly, Sauce, and Vromo. </p>
<h2>Restaurant Accounting Software</h2>
<p>These automate book-keeping (keeping track of sales, accounts payable, accounts receivable, short and long-term debt, etc.), payroll, taxes, payments, and other financial transactions.<br /><br />There are a number of different types of restaurant accounting software. Some popular programs include QuickBooks, Sage 50cloud, and Xero. All three offer a wide range of features, from invoicing and tracking inventory to managing employees’ hours and paying taxes. They also have mobile apps that let you keep an eye on your business.</p>
<h2>Kitchen Display Systems</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/small-business/what-is-a-kds">Restaurant KDS</a> are effectively screens replacing printers in the kitchen, displaying orders coming from the POS to the corresponding station. The best systems have the ability to display recipes one-click-away, monitor cooking times, and alert the FOH when the meal is ready.  <br /><br />KDS can help your restaurant in several ways. By digitizing the process, you can introduce new levels of transparency and accuracy to order-taking. You can see at a glance which orders are lagging and take steps to speed up the process. </p>
<h2>Restaurant Reservation Software</h2>
<p>These enable customers to book a table or venue, maintain real-time waitlists, alert of food allergies, remind guests of an upcoming reservation, etc.<br /><br />Some examples of <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/best-restaurant-reservation-software-5101754">reservations software</a> are OpenTable, Resy, SevenRooms, Tock, and Yelp Reservations. <br /><br /></p>
<h2>Menu Management Software</h2>
<p>With the large number of food delivery aggregators, restaurants have a hard time keeping track of orders in the different systems, not to mention how long it takes to change menu items across platforms.</p>
<p>Several POS platforms are trying to unify the process so that restaurants can manage menu changes across locations and ordering platforms, and so that orders are funneled through one system rather than several separate log-ins. </p>
<h2>Restaurant ERP Systems</h2>
<p>Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) softwares are a comprehensive suite providing real-time insights into the business (mostly used by large chains) and have the ability to manage different streams of work from loyalty campaigns to menu analysis to strategic planning. Some notable <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-ERP-systems-for-the-restaurant-industry">ERP names</a> are Oracle, SAP, and Microsoft Dynamics. They come with a high price tag but offer great scalability for businesses that can afford it. </p>
<h2>Restaurant Marketing &amp; CRM Software</h2>
<p>Marketing software (including customer relationship management) are multi-channel platforms that help plan and run campaigns, track customer satisfaction and other metrics (average customer spend by demographics, engagement, customer acquisition, conversion, etc.). The tools leveraged range <a href="https://aaronallen.com/restaurant-marketing">from e-mail marketing to social media</a>, mobile, ads, local campaigns, pay-per-click, loyalty rewards, SEO, online ordering, and more.<br /><br />Most restaurant management software suites will have a CRM tool as part of their package. However, if you’re looking for more comprehensive software or a la carte options, some notable CRMs in the space include: Sprout Social, ZohoCRM, HubSpot, and Insightly.</p>

				<p>Restaurant venture capital is starting to take on a new meaning. While it may refer to the early financing of a restaurant (or chain), more recent trends and activity have evolved to the term being primarily focused on foodservice technology investments. </p><p>We are currently in the bronze age of restaurant technology, and the golden age is about to come. To participate in big <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-valuation-multiples" target="_blank" rel="noopener">valuation wins</a>, investors have to get in early. In many cases, the revenue and EV acceleration will be like going from 0–60 mph in less than 2.4 seconds (many won’t believe this could happen and will therefore miss the opportunity).</p><p>Some key takeaways: </p><ul><li>Venture capital broke new records during the pandemic (across industries)</li><li>U.S. VC deal value grew almost five times in the last ten years to more than $150 billion</li><li>There are plenty of opportunities for VC investors in foodservice tech, and the upside can be realized quickly</li><li>A sample of foodservice tech companies indicates an average enterprise value growth of $455 million per funding round</li><li>The highest Enterprise Value to Revenue ratio we recorded was not for food delivery companies but for other types of foodservice tech (considering a sample of recent transactions)</li></ul><p>While <a href="https://www.qsrmagazine.com/restaurant-operations/restaurants-brace-flood-investment-money">private equity capital is pouring</a> into the usual choices and boosting valuation for restaurants and more traditional foodservice tech, there’s a lot of new market development within foodservice tech that benefits from VC funding.</p><h2>Venture Capital Not Taking a Break During the Pandemic</h2><p>The M&amp;A activity halt at the onset of the pandemic resulted in many VCs reallocating attention and resources to ventures already in their portfolios — rather than sourcing new deals. This resulted in record numbers for both fundraising and deal value. VC activity in the U.S. reached $156B in 2020 (across all sectors), and there’s a similar amount in dry powder expected to be deployed in 2021.</p><p>VCs are backing <a href="https://aaronallen.com/restaurant-technology">foodservice technology</a> and seeing a wide range of returns. Decisions regarding where to invest today should not be based on what others wanted yesterday or can prove today, it&#8217;s much more about predicting what will happen in the tomorrows ahead.

The valuation step-up in early 2014 was 15.2x (from $25M to $380M) and 5.2x in late 2014 (from $380M to $1.96B). Valuation step-ups stabilized at around 1.5x after that (until the 2.2x jump in the last round of March 2021).</p>					</div>

				<h2>Restaurant Transformation Lessons from 300 Physicists Who Failed and 3 Industry Leaders Who Won Big</h2><p>Executives championing change and technology in restaurants can learn a lot from the failure of a physicist and the loss of two billion dollars. At the time, the largest scientific investment in the history of the world was supposed to go to Waxahachie, Texas, just outside of Dallas, but the project evaporated. The decision came down to one question, or rather, one scientist’s inability to effectively answer one question, and that failed communication meant that one of the most important discoveries in the history of science took place in Switzerland instead of the United States.</p>					</div>

				<p>When the scientists lost the project, they said they were victims of “the revenge of the C-students.” But the lawmakers said the scientists were too arrogant: they’re brilliant people, but they’re not salesmen. The scientists couldn‘t get the politicians to hear what they were saying, and the lawmakers couldn’t get the scientists to say what they needed to hear before approving another billion-dollar investment.</p><p>Those working to effectuate significant change within their organizations will eventually face difficult questions. What answers will satisfy the doubters while achieving the aims of the greater good for the company, employees, customers, and ultimately, the investors and skeptics, too?</p><p>The foodservice organizations that have most successfully <a href="https://aaronallen.com/restaurant-technology">harnessed technology</a> share a few attributes. Most importantly, they started their transformations while facing significant threats. The technological answers they found focused around improving the guest experience rather than enacting change for its own sake. As a result, they increased market share, restored or reinforced relevance, and built incredible value for their organizations. Their secret was not to champion technology in restaurants, but to champion change.</p><h2>Technology in Restaurants: A Breakdown Before Breakthrough</h2><p>It’s easy to point to what the most innovative foodservice organizations have done and highlight their exciting ideas and applications. But if you trace these initiatives back, they came into being because the company needed to revive the business. The genesis of the best tech advances in the industry were turnaround efforts. These companies had breakdowns before they had breakthroughs.</p><p>The U.S. food industry has become incredibly competitive. Of the $3.5t global restaurant industry, $800b is spent there. More than 30% of all industry revenue is earned in the U.S., which has less than 5% of the world’s population. Share only comes at someone else’s expense. And the pressure isn’t just coming from the big guys: it’s also the up-and-coming chains.</p>					</div>

				<p>These fast-expanding brands are increasing their footprints at a 37.5% CAGR. The industry as a whole grows by 3%, on average, annually. If the largest chains are claiming billions, and the newcomers are taking 30%–40% growth, it’s squeezing those in the middle. </p><p>The challenges and opportunities facing the foodservice industry are fairly universal across categories, geographies, and the size of the business. One of the constant refrains is, “<a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-brand-audit">Are we relevant</a>?” This question has <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/casual-dining-restaurant-chains-entering-dangerous-waters">plagued casual dining</a> over the past ten years. Since 2007, it’s had zero growth. </p><p>Many food service companies are turning to technology to restore and maintain their relevance. Others are doing so to create more efficient, and employee-friendly, labor models. Just as mobile order-and-pay apps make restaurants more convenient than ever for guests, so do scheduling apps for their crews, enabling them to swap shifts on their phones (much improved from the old days of driving to the restaurant to put in a shift change request on a corkboard). Some organizations were pushed to make these changes after losing market share while others did more than they had to before they were forced to, but all did so in hopes of meeting and exceeding consumer and employee expectations.</p><h2>Domino’s Won Over Its Critics by Focusing on Convenience</h2><p>Domino’s has reinvented itself as a tech company that sells pizza, but it wasn’t too long ago that it was really struggling. It lost its position as the largest pizza company in the world and had to figure out how to win that title back.</p>					</div>

				<p>To champion change inside an organization, the harshest critics have to be convinced. For Domino’s, that was the customer. In other operations, it’s internal stakeholders. Technological change requires alignment all the way from the crew to the CEO. And even then, the CEO has to answer to the board or public markets, or try to recover from waning public perception.</p><p>Of course, Domino’s numbers speak for themselves. The customer videos above were shot in 2009, and Domino’s stock price has increased tenfold since then. </p><p><a href="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Technology-in-Restaurants-Dominos-Stock.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-12551 size-large" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Technology-in-Restaurants-Dominos-Stock-1024x678.png" alt="Dominos stock price" width="525" height="348" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Technology-in-Restaurants-Dominos-Stock-1024x678.png 1024w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Technology-in-Restaurants-Dominos-Stock-350x232.png 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Technology-in-Restaurants-Dominos-Stock-300x199.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Technology-in-Restaurants-Dominos-Stock-768x509.png 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Technology-in-Restaurants-Dominos-Stock.png 1579w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px" /></a></p><p>And not only that, but the pizza chain eventually came to far outperform Google, Apple, even Amazon, whose CEO just became the richest man in the world. These incredible returns come from Domino’s commitment to making its delivery service as fast and convenient as possible. To put the prescience of this decision into perspective, 10% of all foodservice revenue globally (~$270b) is expected to go through delivery in the next ten years.</p><p>Domino’s even went so far as to build its own car. An organization that was suffering partnered with Ford to develop a vehicle specifically for delivery. In a lot of ways, that thinking may seem counterintuitive, but it’s part of what worked. First, it relates to Domino’s core competency as the leader in pizza delivery. Second, it speaks to how the brands and companies that survive over decades must constantly reinvent themselves. It&#8217;s probably not a coincidence that Domino&#8217;s sought out Ford as a partner: they&#8217;re both historic Detroit-area brands that joined forces to find rejuvenation.</p>					</div>

				<p>Domino’s “Anyware” program has been very successful, and arguably the best case study for technology in restaurants. Consumers can say, “Hey, Alexa, order pizza,” and their favorite Domino’s pizza will show up at their door. They can push a button, and their order processes. That level of convenience, which strips out all of the unnecessary friction points inside the ordering process, can move tremendous amounts of revenue and market share very quickly, as Domino’s has.</p><p>But before Domino’s could launch these programs, its leaders had to win support from top to bottom. In 2012, Patrick Doyle sent Kelly Garcia, SVP of eCommerce Development and Emerging Technologies, and Dennis Maloney, Chief Digital Officer, <a href="https://sherpack.com/best-ecommerce-unboxing-experience/">click to read more</a>, to the board with their plan to transform the company. They won the board’s support and secured the necessary budget. But next they had to win over everyone else, so the company set about changing the culture. It began using the tech transformation as a recruiting tool, so that they could surface the most excited and committed applicants. Now, the chain has very low turnover because its staff is bought into what the company has done — and what it has the potential to do next.</p><h2>Panera Thought Beyond the Quarter and Saved Guests Ten Years of Waiting by Implementing Technology in Restaurants</h2><p>The <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-tech-investment">Panera 2.0 program</a> was an investment of only $40m. Of course, $40m is a lot of money, but on a $5b company, it’s a very small percentage. Panera eventually became one of the top-performing foodservice stocks in history, but CEO Ron Shaich became more and more frustrated by investors’ short-term thinking, so much so that it contributed to his decision to leave the company.</p>					</div>

				<p>In 2015, Steve Easterbrook took over as CEO to a tremendous amount of public criticism. The initial turnaround initiative was packaged in a complicated, 14-point plan that would be almost impossible to execute within such a large organization. But the executive team simplified those ideas, and they’ve been investing heavily in technology.</p><p>The rebound has been remarkable. Easterbrook acknowledged that things had changed more outside the business than inside the business in the last five years. And that’s when he realized that McDonald’s had to move faster. It’s done so, investing hundreds of millions of dollars per quarter in the Experience of the Future initiative. This CAPEX spending is so large, it will make it almost impossible for the rest of the industry to catch up. The market has rewarded this transformation, adding (at its peak) $42b in market capitalization.</p>					</div>

Billions upon billions of dollars are being invested in <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/pizza-restaurant-technology">technology</a>, and the organizations that fall a few steps behind now will find themselves at the back of the pack within a few years.</p><h2>Starbucks Customer-Centric Tech Outpacing the Competition</h2><p>Starbucks became the second-largest foodservice company in the world by adding 2,500 units each year. Operations in the lower portion of the 100 largest chains still haven’t reached that number, and Starbucks is adding it every year. But former CEO Howard Schultz was rejected 217 times when he initially tried to get funding for expansion.</p><p><a href="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Technology-in-Restaurants-Starbucks-Loyalty.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-12546" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Technology-in-Restaurants-Starbucks-Loyalty-1024x592.png" alt="Technology in Restaurants Starbucks Loyalty" width="450" height="260" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Technology-in-Restaurants-Starbucks-Loyalty-1024x592.png 1024w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Technology-in-Restaurants-Starbucks-Loyalty-350x202.png 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Technology-in-Restaurants-Starbucks-Loyalty-300x174.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Technology-in-Restaurants-Starbucks-Loyalty-768x444.png 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Technology-in-Restaurants-Starbucks-Loyalty.png 1729w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a></p><p>One reason for Starbucks’ incredible success is that very tenacity. As customers move to the loyalty program, the coffee chain is seeing all guests — high-spend, medium-spend, and lower-spend customers — add 20%, 30%, and 70% to their orders. In an industry that grows 3% a year, Starbucks is increasing its footprint annually and growing check averages by incredible percentages. Those figures are meaningful not just for Starbucks but for everyone in the industry.</p><p>Starbucks’ tech initiatives aren’t specifically aimed at driving sales. The company is leveraging technology to better serve customers. Its mobile order capability lets guests skip the line, and it has recently installed menu boards that allow customers to communicate via sign language. Meanwhile, sticky tape and squawk boxes, tech that’s state-of-the-art 1979, is still in use by companies whose CEOs are scratching their heads and wondering where their sales and customers rode off to. </p>					</div>

				<p>Within a few years, Amazon will be able to combine its distribution and shipping centers with closer touchpoints and a larger network. Its cashier-free convenience stores are opening in major cities, and it’s testing autonomous delivery vehicles for groceries. Much of the talk around Amazon focuses on this automation, which seems to alter the perception of what’s really happening. It&#8217;s not that robots are taking over; it&#8217;s that convenience and new ways of driving efficiency are changing these organizations from the inside out.</p><p>In consumers&#8217; push for convenience and efficiency, grocery stores will likely have a massive impact on restaurants for the first time in decades. They are 261% more efficient on sales per employee than foodservice operations. Across categories, average sales per unit is growing more slowly than wages, and gains in productivity do not match labor cost increases.</p>					</div>

				<p>While productivity across industries increased a staggering 77.2% between 1987 and 2017, labor productivity in foodservice has grown just 11.7%. Meanwhile labor cost increases in restaurants are outpacing the rest of the economy. Hourly wages have gone up, on average, 11.8%; in foodservice, they’ve increased 17%. As labor costs have gone up, food-away-from-home prices have increased, resulting in a significant gap between prices at restaurants and grocery stores.</p><p>These developments are reversing a 50-year trend. Since the middle of the last century, the restaurant business has reliably taken one point of share of wallet away every year from grocery stores. The industry got so used to this that grocery stores stopped showing up in SWOT conversations, but in 2017, grocery stores took a point back. </p><h2>Champion Change by Putting Colleagues and Guests First</h2><p>When it comes time to champion change, leaders must help stakeholders and shareholders alike move through the progression of commitment until the whole organization experiences a genuine sense of ownership over the transformation.</p>					</div>

				<p>Even the most experienced captains rely on pilots with technical expertise to help them through the Panama Canal; even skippers of small vessels know it’s wise to navigate unfamiliar waters with the latest maps. Many leaders turn to experienced and objective advisors to augment resources and capabilities throughout the course of a transformation drive, which often follows this path:</p><ol><li><em>Identify the problem</em>. Asking and answering the right — sometimes difficult — questions about what’s truly impacting performance is a critical, but often overlooked, first step in a successful change initiative. Change for the sake of change often produces more effort than result. Transformation benefits companies when it is in service of a specific goal.</li><li><em>Assess feasibility</em>. Finding the right size for the initiative and balancing it against other competing business priorities across the system ensures that the results maximize value and return. Informed by diagnostic work, including dynamic what-if scenario models, these questions are easier to answer than “will we find God,” but no less essential to success.</li><li><em>Prioritize and plan</em>. What’s the gap between where the organization is and where it wants to be? A <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-strategic-planning">comprehensive rollout plan</a> lays out a clear path to the finish line for all shareholders and highlights the essential role they will play bringing it to life, enrolling them in the necessary work.</li><li><em>Design and develop</em>. Moving from the big idea to its practical implementation means considering its operational impacts across functional areas of the business. Rushing through this stage can create unforeseen challenges throughout the system, delaying deployment and damaging buy-in.</li><li><em>Champion change</em>. A successful rollout requires broad support, and leaders who align incentives can move more quickly and confidently than those who still have to convince others of the benefits of the program. Highlighting how the new technology in restaurants or procedures will impact employees’ day-to-day activities, how it reflects the core values of the organization, and most importantly, how it will benefit them — as well as the guests and community — creates real, committed enthusiasm.</li><li><em>Monitor, manage, and maintain</em>. If you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it. Establishing KPIs, installing dashboards, and institutionalizing best practices turn anecdote and opinion into data-driven insights about the pilot program’s performance.</li><li><em>Reiterate and refine</em>. The most successful companies are those that have radically reinvented themselves at least once and look forward to doing so again. They take a methodical approach to enacting a transformation in order to surface more opportunities to improve performance. This recursive process helps refine the technical aspects of the initiative, but it also means guest and employee experience can direct the recalibrations, making the final product a truly shared venture.</li></ol><p><a href="https://aaronallen.com/services">Expert guidance</a> helps overcome possible limitations and setbacks by reducing corporate inertia or cognitive bias and challenging potentially flawed assumptions to ensure a program reaches its fullest potential. The most seasoned executives are often those who are best positioned to recognize when there are dangers that justify enlisting the help of others.</p><p>The best transformations aren’t only in the pursuit of change. They’re in the pursuit of delivering exceptional guest and employee engagement, competitive differentiation, and increased productivity and efficiency.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Once a fairly humble piece of paper, the menu has evolved to become one of the most complex components of one of the most complex businesses in the world. Restaurant menus are a convergence of nearly every other facet of the business: marketing, supply chain, interaction, design, fulfillment production, copywriting, merchandising, etc. When combined effectively, they form the single most important piece of marketing collateral a restaurant can have. But as menus have changed over the years, so has their design — and menu merchandising is now a bigger challenge (and greater opportunity) than ever before. When it comes to technology&#8217;s impact on modern-day <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-menu-design" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">menu design</a> and menu merchandising, we&#8217;re seeing something that&#8217;s absolutely brand new; something that will disrupt the industry in ways we couldn&#8217;t have imagined ten years ago. Fortunes will be made and lost over the next few years based on how well companies understand — and ultimately utilize — these technologies. It sounds like a tall order, to be sure</p>
<h1>The Evolution of Menu Merchandising</h1>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10605" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/mcdonalds-menu-merchandising.jpg" alt="mcdonalds menu merchandising" width="2002" height="406" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/mcdonalds-menu-merchandising.jpg 2002w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/mcdonalds-menu-merchandising-350x71.jpg 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/mcdonalds-menu-merchandising-300x61.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/mcdonalds-menu-merchandising-768x156-1.jpg 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/mcdonalds-menu-merchandising-1024x208-1.jpg 1024w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/mcdonalds-menu-merchandising-970x197-1.jpg 970w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/mcdonalds-menu-merchandising-500x101-1.jpg 500w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/mcdonalds-menu-merchandising-220x45-1.jpg 220w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/mcdonalds-menu-merchandising-160x32-1.jpg 160w" sizes="(max-width: 2002px) 100vw, 2002px" /> Tens of millions of dollars have been poured in to understand menu <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/the-psychology-of-menu-design" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">psychology</a>, merchandising, and engineering over the years. Yet some of those principals are as old as evolution itself: having things stand out in evolutionary (it&#8217;s the reason our instincts kick in when we see a lion hiding in a bush, for instance. We&#8217;re trained to notice if something is different than its surroundings.) These techniques have lately begun to evolve even further and faster. While some techniques remain tried and true, there are new pieces to the puzzle: interface design in kiosks and apps, for instance, the design of a mobile menu, etc. The $4 trillion global restaurant industry is one of many struggling with the fact that the consumer is moving faster than most restaurant chains can even comprehend. Many are left in a state of flux, while other chains are seeing tremendous growth thanks to emerging technologies — and reaping the rewards in terms of both higher stock prices and customer happiness.</p>
<h1>How New Ways of Dining Are Impacting Menu Merchandising</h1>
<p>New restaurant technologies (digital menus, mobile app ordering, kiosks, interface design) are beneficial for many reasons. For one thing, merchandising is already built into many mobile order technologies. It&#8217;s not always possible to track whether servers are up-selling to each customer, for instance. Not only is this good for guests (in terms of the convenience of seeing popular items called out on a menu), but it&#8217;s good for operations, leading to faster purchasing and ordering decisions and higher order accuracy. Technology certainly has its benefits — but it comes with a unique set of challenges, too. For operators, technology greatly enhances the capabilities of menu merchandising, into the realm of things like neuro-marketing, for instance. Neuro-marketing (which uses medical technologies such as functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to study the brain’s responses to marketing stimuli) isn’t even on the horizon for many chains. Other restaurant companies, meanwhile (Starbucks, Domino&#8217;s, Pizza Hut, etc.) are actively investing in technology like machine learning, AI, advanced algorithms for menus and self-ordering.</p>
<h1>Why Proper Menu Merchandising is Critical</h1>
<p>Sixty-five percent of every dollar a restaurant brings in, goes back out in food and labor costs. Such slim margins make it even more important to ensure there&#8217;s not too much waste (and therefore describe menu items in a way that’s compelling and unique). Restaurants that aren&#8217;t managing that well will likely see guest experience suffer as a result. If a pizza restaurant is consistently out of pepperoni, for instance, it&#8217;s probably a sure bet that their traffic will begin to decline. Psychology and biology both play a role. If a menu is merchandised such that the most profitable items are placed in the areas where people look the most, that can give a restaurant a tremendous advantage. Those techniques have been applied to menus for decades, of course, though the evolution is astounding: sure, more chains are turning to nested pricing (which allows guests to focus on the headline and item description rather than its price), but they&#8217;re also utilizig 3D techniques and animation on digital menus. The latest techniques can sequence how guests consume information, walking them through a menu in a logical way that makes the ordering process feel much easier and more intuitive. There can be too much of a good thing, though. Over-do it, and a restaurant can create a conflict for the guest: a paradox of choice. If too many items look too good, a guest often feels as if they&#8217;ve missed out on something good. Lately, some chains have caught on to the paradox of choice. Some casual dining chains, which historically lacked the displicine to remove older items after unveiling newer ones, have lately been revealing re-vamped, <a href="https://today.yougov.com/news/2017/10/12/chilis-new-menu-generates-purchase-consideration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slimmed-down menus</a>.</p>
<h1>The Menu Merchandising Mix</h1>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10606" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/technology-menu-merchandising.jpg" alt="technology menu merchandising" width="940" height="888" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/technology-menu-merchandising.jpg 940w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/technology-menu-merchandising-350x331.jpg 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/technology-menu-merchandising-300x283.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/technology-menu-merchandising-768x726-1.jpg 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/technology-menu-merchandising-500x472-1.jpg 500w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/technology-menu-merchandising-131x124-1.jpg 131w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/technology-menu-merchandising-95x90-1.jpg 95w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px" /> The best menu merchandising is a blend — an analysis of what&#8217;s profitable, as well as a knowledge of engineering side, and merchandising techniques. Because so much is involved, it&#8217;s not as easy as simply uploading a menu to a website. Today, it&#8217;s about optimizing a menu for mobile, for web speeds, etc. Those who get it right carve out a tremendous advantage for themselves in the process. On average, our clients have witnessed $12,000 in net profit increase per million dollars in revenue just by re-arranging the items on their menus. By analyzing what items are selling, what&#8217;s not selling — and applying proper engineering techniques (the structure of the document) and merchandising techniques (the design of the document) — can dramatically impact what guests buy and how they interact with a menu.</p>

What we’ve discovered shows not only that investments in digital delivery are growing at an incredible rate, but also that this still-new segment is showing remarkable returns on those investments.</p><p>This has created an incredibly competitive environment as service providers carve up the market in hopes of claiming particular segments and geographies for themselves. Meanwhile, a flurry of mergers and acquisitions are leading to greater consolidation.</p><p>In December 2016, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/14/delivery-hero-just-eat/">Just Eat bought</a> Delivery Hero’s UK operation, called hungryhouse, as well as Canada’s SkipTheDishes, and just last month, China’s massive <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/27/alibaba-ele-me-plate-up/">Alibaba scooped up Ele.me</a> in hopes of cornering food delivery market in that country. It’s been reported that <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/4/6/17173478/postmates-doordash-merger-restaurant-delivery">DoorDash and Postmates</a> are discussing a merger in hopes of surviving the combined onslaught of Grubhub, Uber Eats, and Amazon, which, with its purchase of Whole Foods, is gaining traction in the grocery-delivery market. This land grab is likely to continue until each segment and market has its own leading provider. What will set the winners of this battle apart will not only be consumer-facing service but also how well they serve the restaurants that form the basis of their business. While these organizations started as tech companies, they need to start thinking like foodservice operators.</p><h2>Grubhub: Incredible Growth, Strong Fundamentals</h2><p>In the US, Grubhub has had much higher — and more sustained — revenue growth than the top ten publicly traded restaurants. These chains, which include McDonald’s, Starbucks, and Chipotle, have seen their revenue grow at a median 11.1% CAGR since 2013, but Grubhub has outpaced them by 3.3x, with a 47.4% CAGR.</p><p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10735" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Grubhub-Revenue-Growing-Faster-than-Publicly-Traded-Restaurants.png" alt="" width="974" height="643" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Grubhub-Revenue-Growing-Faster-than-Publicly-Traded-Restaurants.png 974w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Grubhub-Revenue-Growing-Faster-than-Publicly-Traded-Restaurants-350x231.png 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Grubhub-Revenue-Growing-Faster-than-Publicly-Traded-Restaurants-300x198.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Grubhub-Revenue-Growing-Faster-than-Publicly-Traded-Restaurants-768x507.png 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Grubhub-Revenue-Growing-Faster-than-Publicly-Traded-Restaurants-970x640.png 970w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Grubhub-Revenue-Growing-Faster-than-Publicly-Traded-Restaurants-500x330.png 500w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Grubhub-Revenue-Growing-Faster-than-Publicly-Traded-Restaurants-188x124.png 188w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Grubhub-Revenue-Growing-Faster-than-Publicly-Traded-Restaurants-136x90.png 136w" sizes="(max-width: 974px) 100vw, 974px" /></p><p>Not only that, but Grubhub’s trajectory has been much steadier, growing from $137m in 2013 to a projected $952m in 2018. In contrast, chains had a lot of ground to make up after a massive drop in revenue in 2014. When it comes to valuation, the top ten chains have been posting respectable EV/EBITDA ratios for the past five years. (They average 14.7x; the S&amp;P average for 2017 was 12.8x.) Grubhub’s, however, is growing by leaps and bounds to 35.8x (+116% since 2015).</p><p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10736" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Grubhub-Valuation-Doubles-in-Three-Years.png" alt="Grubhub Valuation Doubles in Three Years" width="974" height="643" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Grubhub-Valuation-Doubles-in-Three-Years.png 974w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Grubhub-Valuation-Doubles-in-Three-Years-350x231.png 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Grubhub-Valuation-Doubles-in-Three-Years-300x198.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Grubhub-Valuation-Doubles-in-Three-Years-768x507.png 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Grubhub-Valuation-Doubles-in-Three-Years-970x640.png 970w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Grubhub-Valuation-Doubles-in-Three-Years-500x330.png 500w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Grubhub-Valuation-Doubles-in-Three-Years-188x124.png 188w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Grubhub-Valuation-Doubles-in-Three-Years-136x90.png 136w" sizes="(max-width: 974px) 100vw, 974px" /></p><p>Of course, not all delivery companies are created equal. While services that provide meals to people’s homes are seeing their market caps grow at a median 29% CAGR, the American meal-kit delivery company Blue Apron has lost almost half (-48%) of its capitalization since its IPO last year.</p><p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10737" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Publicly-Traded-Food-Delivery-Companies.png" alt="Publicly Traded Food Delivery" width="974" height="645" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Publicly-Traded-Food-Delivery-Companies.png 974w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Publicly-Traded-Food-Delivery-Companies-350x232.png 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Publicly-Traded-Food-Delivery-Companies-300x199.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Publicly-Traded-Food-Delivery-Companies-768x509.png 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Publicly-Traded-Food-Delivery-Companies-970x642.png 970w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Publicly-Traded-Food-Delivery-Companies-500x331.png 500w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Publicly-Traded-Food-Delivery-Companies-187x124.png 187w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Publicly-Traded-Food-Delivery-Companies-136x90.png 136w" sizes="(max-width: 974px) 100vw, 974px" /></p><p>Blue Apron’s problems appear throughout its financials.

Blue Apron is working in an incredibly competitive sector, as other tech companies, like Instacart and Amazon, have started offering grocery deliveries. Even Target has started offering curbside delivery. At the same time, Blue Apron has been dogged by <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/carolineodonovan/blue-apron-has-been-fined-for-safety-violations-again?utm_term=.deYmQ0Z9O4#.kvyz8yVO47">labor safety violations</a> that have produced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/21/blue-apron-hit-with-class-action-lawsuit-from-shareholders/">investor lawsuits</a> and hurt <a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/8/11/16127050/blue-apron-q2-earnings-warehouse-issues-linden-new-jersey-matt-salzberg">every single aspect</a> of the company’s operation.</p><p>In a recent newsletter, we proposed an alternative suggestion: convenience-seeking diners aren’t looking for food delivered to their doors; they want meals delivered to their doors. The data might also indicate that people aren’t interested in subscriptions, preferring instead to make their dinner decisions at the last minute, based on how much time they have and what they’re craving.</p><p>More research into consumer preferences is necessary before we know exactly why Blue Apron is performing so poorly, but it’s clear that Grubhub is winning the battle. Compared to the meal-kit provider’s 0.33x valuation and -9% EBITDA margin, the delivery aggregator had a 9.43x valuation and 26% EBITDA.</p><h2>Become Indispensable</h2><p>These delivery companies’ success is built on their restaurant partners. Our data shows that delivery and takeout companies’ valuations equal a median 1.1x sales for every 10,000 restaurants they work with.</p><p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10738" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Delivery-and-Takeout-Companies.png" alt="Delivery and Takeout Companies" width="974" height="645" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Delivery-and-Takeout-Companies.png 974w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Delivery-and-Takeout-Companies-350x232.png 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Delivery-and-Takeout-Companies-300x199.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Delivery-and-Takeout-Companies-768x509.png 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Delivery-and-Takeout-Companies-970x642.png 970w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Delivery-and-Takeout-Companies-500x331.png 500w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Delivery-and-Takeout-Companies-187x124.png 187w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Delivery-and-Takeout-Companies-136x90.png 136w" sizes="(max-width: 974px) 100vw, 974px" /></p><p>This is fairly simple math, but, when compared to even the highest-performing publicly traded restaurants, we find an incredible gap. The top quartile of public foodservice companies has a 2.02x EV-to-sales ratio; Grubhub, which works with some 80,000 restaurants, has more than four times, with a 9.00x valuation multiple.</p><p>Even more stunning is the Dutch company Takeaway.com. With just 33,000 restaurant partners, it’s posting a 12.7x valuation multiple.</p><p>Thanks to the immense value at stake, providers are battling to sign partnerships from the most sought-after restaurants, and we can expect the pace of mergers and acquisitions in this segment to continue to accelerate.</p><p>Of course, restaurants are getting something out of the deal as well. They’re are earning between $31,000 (for German Delivery Hero) to $55,000 (for British Just Eat) in revenue through these services. More research is needed to determine how much of this revenue is incremental and how much represents a cannibalization of existing orders.</p><div class="infogram-embed" data-id="241dae72-dc33-44c7-bb95-b7c91ca22cb2" data-type="interactive" data-title="Food Delivery Companies"> </div><p><script>!function(e,t,n,s){var i="InfogramEmbeds",o=e.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?"http:":"https:";if(/^\/{2}/.test(s)&&(s=d+s),window[i]&&window[i].initialized)window[i].process&&window[i].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var a=e.createElement(t);a.async=1,a.id=n,a.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(a,o)}}(document,"script","infogram-async","https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js");</script></p><p>Most delivery service providers have focused on winning over consumers by offering discounts and coupons, multiple ways to access the service (via desktop, mobile, Smart TV, and so on), and, of course, the most popular restaurants. This makes sense, considering how sticky these apps are for customers: some studies indicate that about three-quarters of consumers stick with the very first provider they try. (Anecdotally, one member of our staff downloaded the Grubhub app when it first came out and has never tried another service; everyone else is much more adventurous.)</p><p>Now, the smartest and most agile of these companies will shift their attention to restaurants, offering services specifically designed to help operators increase sales and revenue.</p><p>This requires a radical re-understanding of their core business. After all, Grubhub, Uber Eats, and DoorDash are technology companies first: they created a platform that connects restaurants to hungry consumers and, in some cases, a fleet of delivery staff. Domino’s CEO Patrick Doyle has described his operation as a tech company that sells pizzas — a pivot that, as we’ll see in a moment, is paying off handsomely. But now, delivery companies need to develop a deep understanding of the needs and concerns of restaurant operators or risk losing them to competitors or in-house apps.</p><p>As we saw above, restaurants of all sizes and from all segments get clear benefits by signing with delivery services — not only does it grow revenue, but it builds new customer bases, increases order size and frequency, and provides the restaurant with mobile ordering capabilities and, in some cases, dedicated delivery staff.</p><p>At the same time, delivery charges take away between 13% and 18% (on average) of this new revenue. Further, savvy restaurant operators might take a look at this data — the incredible valuations, the strong EV/Sales ratios, and the booming stock prices — and decide they shouldn’t hand all this over to a third party.</p><p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10739" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Grubhub-Stock-Price.png" alt="" width="974" height="645" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Grubhub-Stock-Price.png 974w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Grubhub-Stock-Price-350x232.png 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Grubhub-Stock-Price-300x199.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Grubhub-Stock-Price-768x509.png 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Grubhub-Stock-Price-970x642.png 970w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Grubhub-Stock-Price-500x331.png 500w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Grubhub-Stock-Price-187x124.png 187w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Grubhub-Stock-Price-136x90.png 136w" sizes="(max-width: 974px) 100vw, 974px" /></p><p>For example, of publicly traded restaurant companies, only Domino’s Pizza comes close to matching Grubhub’s impressive stock-price rise, which we see skyrocketed with its acquisition of competitor Eat24 in August 2017. What sets Domino’s apart from McDonald’s is that the pizza chain has innovated on its own to offer its consumers a variety of different ways to make and receive orders. The delivery providers that can give these restaurants something they can’t develop on their own — becoming indispensable to sales and operations — are the ones that will survive.</p><p>A lot of uncertainty remains as delivery providers further carve up the foodservice market then merge with and/or acquire competitors to increase market share. What remains clear is that there is a lot of revenue and value up for grabs here, and those who innovate first will have higher chances of claiming it.</p>					</div>

				<p>With Amazon&#8217;s acquisition of Whole Foods, new dietary habits shaping the way we eat, and whole new dining categories cropping up, it&#8217;s clear that the restaurant industry (and food, at large) is in flux. In a November webinar, CB Insights Senior Intelligence Analyst Zoe Leavitt delved further into new investment into F&amp;B, along with the latest trends to attract investors. Here&#8217;s what we learned about how the latest crop of food startups are transforming our diets — and the industry at large.</p>
<h1>Food Trends Are Giving Way to Massive Investment</h1>
<p>Restaurant chains are facing a wide variety of challenges, be it activist investors or new ways of eating. Food delivery, for one, has dramatically altered the landscape. Already, grocers and restaurants alike are facing falling foot traffic and losing share to e-commerce options. Amazon, for instance, captures nearly 20% of the online grocery share.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10644" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/4.-number-of-Americans-who-buy-groceries-online.jpg" alt="4. number of Americans who buy groceries online" width="2592" height="1944"/><br />We all know about Amazon, of course (though, to be clear, the full ramifications of its effect on the restaurant industry remains to be seen). A slew of high-momentum F&amp;B startups are also making their mark. Leavitt noted two major upheavals in the F&amp;B sector: Chobani a startup that, in 2016, became the top-selling yogurt brand in the country (and spurred the growth of the yogurt industry as a whole) and Halo Top, a healthy ice cream startup, became the number-one selling ice cream pint in 2017 and eroded Unilever&#8217;s market share.</p>
<p>Deal to F&amp;B startups have been setting new records every year since 2013, according to CB Insights data. Alongside the number of deals, the number of investors backing these startups has also skyrocketed. One of the most prolific investor is JAB Holdings, which has focused mostly on coffee in recent years, acquiring Panera, Peet&#8217;s Coffee &amp; Tea, Stumptown and Intelligentsia. Peet&#8217;s itself recently made its first equity investment into another beverage trend, acquiring Revive Kombucha.</p>
<h1>Large Corporates Are Looking to Small Food Startups for Inspiration</h1>
<p>Rather than wait around for the next Halo Top or Chobani to surface, corporates are getting into the game themselves, launching venture funds, accelerators and incubators to form relationships with food startups early on. The varied investment strategies of Campbell Soup, Kellogg’s, and other large brands is proof positive that even small startups are making a big impact.</p>
<p>Nestlé, the world&#8217;s largest F&amp;B company, has been increasingly active in the startup sector, investing in healthy foods (they acquired frozen food product Sweet Earth, as well as human-grade pet food product Terra Canis. They also invested in Freshly, a direct-to-consumer meal kit company, and acquired Blue Bottle, a premium coffee chain, for $700 million.</p>
<p>Unilever has been active as well, acquiring two tea companies (Tazo, which is acquired from Starbucks, and Pukka Herbs), along with other companies with a focus on healthy foods. Kellogg&#8217;s has focused largely on investments into the healthy breakfast category through its investment arm, eighteen94 Capital. General Mills launched its venture fund, 301 Inc., in 2015. Nearly all its investments are in vegetable and plant-based products.</p>
<h1>Startups are Leveraging Healthful Ingredients To Attract Both Consumers and Investors</h1>
<p>Startups are betting big on unique, healthful ingredients — things like probiotics, turmeric, algae, plant proteins, and more — to woo both funding dollars as well as customers. Of course, this segment hasn&#8217;t been without it&#8217;s challenges. Case in point: Soylent, the meal replacement drink startup which launched in 2013 with $3 million in crowdsourced funding. By May 2017, the company had raised $50 million in venture capital. But the journey came with a few pretty high-profile setbacks.</p>
<p>In 2016, a number of customers became violently ill after consuming Soylent’s powder mix and protein bars. The company reformulated the powder but has yet to re-introduce its bars. Even more unwanted attention came just months later, after Soylent issued a voluntary recall when it discovered a small amount of milk product may have inadvertendly slipped into some of its lactose- and milk-free products. Canada also recently banned Soylent (arguing it doesn&#8217;t contain enough nutrients to be a true meal replacement), a signal that future struggles could be in the pipeline.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10641" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/burger-food-startup.jpg" alt="burger food startup" width="908" height="922" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/burger-food-startup.jpg 908w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/burger-food-startup-350x355.jpg 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/burger-food-startup-295x300-1.jpg 295w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/burger-food-startup-768x780-1.jpg 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/burger-food-startup-54x54-1.jpg 54w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/burger-food-startup-500x508-1.jpg 500w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/burger-food-startup-300x305-1.jpg 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/burger-food-startup-122x124-1.jpg 122w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/burger-food-startup-89x90-1.jpg 89w" sizes="(max-width: 908px) 100vw, 908px" /></p>
<p>Lab-grown meat and other meat substitutes is another unique trend that we&#8217;ll start to see more of in the coming months and years. Even traditional meat companies are hedging their bets by investing in unique and natural products — Tyson Foods, a leading meat producer, invested into Beyond Meat; Cargill invested into Memphis Meats (a lab-grown substitute); and dairy producer Dean Foods invested into Good Karma, which sells dairy-free beverages.</p>
<p>The cost of lab-grown meat has dropped significantly since it was first introduced. In 2013, MosaMeat unveiled a burger that cost $300,000 to produce. Today, a lab-grown or synthetic burger costs roughly $11 to produce.</p>
<h1>New Technologies Will Shape the Industry Moving Forward</h1>
<p>Overall, <a href="https://aaronallen.com/restaurant-technology">technology</a> — think AI, drones, <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-robotics">restaurant robotics</a>, and blockchain — will transform food supply chains and distribution. But new trends will shape them, as well. For instance, supply chains will likely scale and grow more efficient as products like pea protein begin to take off. Other long-term trends to watch fermentation technologies (Ginkgo Bioworks uses fermentation to design custom microbes for clients like cosmetics and meat companies, while Finless Foods uses fermentation to culture synthetic fish, like Bluefin Tuna).</p>
<p>Technology could also impact the environment, with more of a push being made toward edible packaging (to-go bowls made of seaweed, for instance). Lab-grown meat will likely have a major impact, as well, leading to a massive reduction in water and land usage, as well as greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>Biotech will alter the food supply chain dramtically, allowing products to stay fresher, longer. Longer shelf lives will benefit farmers (who wouldn&#8217;t have to get rid of their product so quickly) as well as restaurants (who could reduce waste due to less spoilage).</p>

				<p>Consumers are evolving faster than the supply chain, with inventory management becoming increasingly problematic for restaurant operators and those who invest in chains. And the more money a chain has tied up in inventory, the harder it is to get a handle on lowering food costs.

Still, equity funding remains high, though it varies greatly. To date, the total equity funding of BevSpot ($17.09m), for instance, is 1,139 times that of companies like TrakBar (BevSpot has done four rounds, versus one round for TrakBar) and was founded two years earlier.</p><p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10402" src="http://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Restaurant-inventory-management-software-chart.png" alt="Restaurant inventory management software chart" width="886" height="620" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Restaurant-inventory-management-software-chart.png 886w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Restaurant-inventory-management-software-chart-350x245.png 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Restaurant-inventory-management-software-chart-300x210.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Restaurant-inventory-management-software-chart-768x537.png 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Restaurant-inventory-management-software-chart-500x350.png 500w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Restaurant-inventory-management-software-chart-177x124.png 177w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Restaurant-inventory-management-software-chart-129x90.png 129w" sizes="(max-width: 886px) 100vw, 886px" /></p><p>Below, we round up the above startups, as well as some of the other companies aiming to impact the way restaurants manage their supply chains.</p><h1>RESTAURANT INVENTORY MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE COMPANIES</h1><p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10372" src="http://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/aldelo_pos_inventory-management-e1505501391377.png" alt="aldelo_pos_inventory management" width="200" height="62" /></p><p><strong>Aldelo POS Pro</strong> offers inventory tools, point-of-sale features, seating management, financial tools, and workforce management.

Even more challenging is that products often come via multiple vendors, and are sometimes subject to few standards and processes.</p><p>Accurately tracking inventory not only yields less waste, lower food costs, and higher profits, but it helps calculate the cost of goods sold and to better track food usage. Doing so through the use of software ensures better integration and more accuracy (especially beneficial when it comes to leaky profits). Conducting regular inventories has also been shown to increase restaurant profits by more than 20% each year, largely because it keeps companies from over-ordering.</p><p>Of course, every restaurant understands the importance of tracking inventory — the real draw with restaurant inventory management software is that it allows operators to spend less manual work crunching numbers, focusing instead on analyzing data. &#8220;Data&#8221; is a term thrown around a lot in foodservice these days and, while it&#8217;s important, it doesn&#8217;t mean much if it isn&#8217;t analyzed. Inventory solutions empower chains to make better sense of data, leading to more intelligent decision-making that improves the bottom line.</p><h2>RELATED CONTENT</h2><p><a href="http://aaronallen.com/blog/food-tech-ipos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Recent History of Food Tech IPOs</a></p><p><a href="http://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-delivery-tech" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Biggest Names in Food and Restaurant Delivery Tech</a></p><p><a href="http://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-digital-ordering-tech-dominos-starbucks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Most Tech-Friendly Restaurant Chains Are Reaping the Largest Returns</a></p><p><a href="http://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-food-commodities" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Restaurant Food Commodities: Current Trends</a></p><h3>ABOUT AARON ALLEN &amp; ASSOCIATES:</h3><p><a href="http://aaronallen.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Aaron Allen &amp; Associates</a> is a leading global restaurant industry consultancy specializing in growth strategy, marketing, branding, and <a href="http://aaronallen.com/restaurant-commercial-due-diligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commercial due diligence</a> for emerging restaurant chains and prestigious <a href="http://aaronallen.com/restaurant-private-equity." target="_blank" rel="noopener">private equity</a> firms.

The company was acquired in October 2016 by Ziff Davis, a digital media company in the technology, gaming and lifestyle categories, and is no longer public.</p><p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10202" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/just-eat-logo-food-tech-IPOs-e1504029512666.jpg" alt="just-eat-logo-food-tech-IPOs" width="250" height="132" /></p><p><strong>Just Eat</strong></p><p>Just Eat&#8217;s 2014 debut was the biggest UK tech IPO in the seven years prior. At the time of the IPO on the London Stock Exchange, the market valued the company at £1.47 billion ($2.44 billion). Today, it hovers at some $4.1 billion.</p><h1>THE BEST (AND WORST) FOOD TECH STOCK PERFORMERS</h1><p>Most of these food-tech stocks have seen price increases since their IPO (all except Blue Apron). While Square doubled its stock prince (since its IPO and until the end of August 2017), Quotient Technology, Just Eat, and Grub Hub all saw stock price increases larger than 50%. On the other hand, Blue Apron which first began trading at the end of June 2017, accumulated a price drop close to 50% by the end of August 2017.</p><div class="infogram-embed" data-id="a37978e0-2282-4104-9b14-a4c515b53f1d" data-type="interactive" data-title="Food Tech Stocks since IPO"> </div><p><script>!function(e,t,s,i){var n="InfogramEmbeds",o=e.getElementsByTagName("script"),d=o[0],r=/^http:/.test(e.location)?"http:":"https:";if(/^\/{2}/.test(i)&&(i=r+i),window[n]&&window[n].initialized)window[n].process&&window[n].process();else if(!e.getElementById(s)){var a=e.createElement("script");a.async=1,a.id=s,a.src=i,d.parentNode.insertBefore(a,d)}}(document,0,"infogram-async","https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js");</script></p><p>Blue Apron&#8217;s stock troubles have been blamed in large part on Amazon&#8217;s recent acquisition of Whole Foods. Less than two months after its initial public offering, the meal kit&#8217;s stock was hovering at around half its IPO price, leading some to call it a &#8220;catastrophe&#8221; and a &#8220;disaster&#8221; further impacted by multiple shareholder lawsuits claiming that company management misled investors.</p><p>In July, Blue Apron&#8217;s stock was deemed the worst-performing large IPO of 2017 by Renaissance Capital (a manager of IPO-focused ETFs). The company has faced questions over its high customer-acquisition costs as well as increasing competition from Amazon, which moved into the meal-kit space shortly after Blue Apron went public.</p><p>Those in the online food and delivery space have fared a little better, though it&#8217;s worth pointing out that the sector is becoming increasingly competitive – especially with the addition of large players like Amazon and Uber entering the space. Meanwhile, other, newer companies, continue to expand.</p><p>But even despite its struggles, the continued popularity of Blue Apron and meal kit companies like it is already affecting restaurants. Over the last two years, the increase in sales of Blue Apron has significantly outpaced the growth of restaurant sales in the US. Though meal kits are estimated to represent less than 1% of restaurant sales, outstanding growth such as the one experienced by Blue Apron is taking a toll on pockets of the industry.</p><p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10262" src="https://aaronallen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Blue-Apron-sales-verse-restaurants.jpg" alt="Blue Apron sales verse restaurants" width="1180" height="778" srcset="https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Blue-Apron-sales-verse-restaurants.jpg 1180w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Blue-Apron-sales-verse-restaurants-350x231.jpg 350w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Blue-Apron-sales-verse-restaurants-300x198.png 300w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Blue-Apron-sales-verse-restaurants-768x506-1.jpg 768w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Blue-Apron-sales-verse-restaurants-1024x675-1.jpg 1024w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Blue-Apron-sales-verse-restaurants-970x640-1.jpg 970w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Blue-Apron-sales-verse-restaurants-500x330-1.jpg 500w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Blue-Apron-sales-verse-restaurants-188x124-1.jpg 188w, https://11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Blue-Apron-sales-verse-restaurants-137x90-1.jpg 137w" sizes="(max-width: 1180px) 100vw, 1180px" /></p><h1>THE FUTURE OF FOOD TECH IPOs &amp; WHAT THEY MEAN FOR THE INDUSTRY</h1><p>So far, 2017 has already seen two high-profile food tech IPOs: those of Blue Apron and Delivery Hero. Certainly not yet a frenzy in terms of companies going public, but the activity isn&#8217;t slowing down. There&#8217;s speculation that a number of food tech companies will hit the market in the coming months and years, including HelloFresh (which initially filed in 2015, but put its IPO on hold), Zomato, and Yext. There are also rumors that, if it can fix some of its internal issues with a new CEO at the helm, Uber will soon go public in a multi-billion-dollar (some speculate as much as $100 billion) IPO.</p><p>With so many companies cropping up — and eventually going public — the sheer scale of options for implementing tech in a restaurant is overwhelming. But those who continue lagging behind are widening the gap between their dated business models and industry leaders, like those who have unveiled high-tech point-of-sale systems, self-ordering kiosks, mobile ordering, and food delivery. Those who wait it out, to see how other chains handle innovation and how guests respond, will find themselves at a considerable disadvantage. Technology moves fast and the urgency for innovation is growing.</p><h2>OTHER RELATED CONTENT</h2><p><a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-initial-public-offering-ipo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A History of Restaurant Initial Public Offerings, 2000-2017</a></p><p><a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-tech-investment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Panera Saved Customers 10 Lifetimes Worth of Waiting</a></p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-tech-killing-off-independent-pizzerias-aaron-d-allen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How Tech is Killing Off Independent Pizzerias</a></p><h3>ABOUT AARON ALLEN &amp; ASSOCIATES:</h3><p><a href="https://aaronallen.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Aaron Allen &amp; Associates</a> is a leading global restaurant industry consultancy specializing in growth strategy, marketing, branding, commercial due diligence for emerging restaurant chains and prestigious <a href="https://aaronallen.com/restaurant-private-equity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">private equity firms</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Food and restaurant delivery tech is a hot industry. According to our estimates, some $3.2 billion in funding has poured into the restaurant delivery space — to put this in perspective, that&#8217;s just shy of the $3.79 billion that’s been earned by ALL restaurant IPOs in the last 10 years. Still, despite the investor interest, food delivery is a highly competitive industry, as evidenced by the sheer number of companies aiming to carve a niche in the market, some of which are already struggling.</p>
<p>Meal delivery companies Maple, SpoonRocket, and Sprig all ceased operations in 2017, despite having raised a combined $108 million. California-based meal-delivery startup Munchery has been struggling, too, laying off 30 workers at the beginning of 2017 and reportedly wasting food at an alarming rate. The cannibalization brought on by so many companies is apparent elsewhere outside the US, too. Despite support from marquee investors, India&#8217;s TinyOwl Technology (a mobile food ordering app) shut down in 2016, reportedly as a result of operational troubles. As of August 2017, at least 15 mergers and acquisitions had occurred among food delivery startups. In the coming months and years, we&#8217;ll likely see even new food delivery startups launch, while others will likely acquire (or be acquired) or fold entirely.</p>
<p>Below, a roundup of the biggest names in restaurant and food delivery technology services, from meal kits to e-grocers.</p>
<h2>WHO&#8217;S WHO AMONG FOOD &amp; RESTAURANT DELIVERY TECH COMPANIES</h2>
<p>Food delivery is a vast category — one that, up until just a few years ago, probably conjured up images of Chinese takeout boxes and Pizza Hut orders placed over the phone. Today, just about everything can be delivered, and hundreds of companies are hoping to be the next &#8220;Uber of food.&#8221; The meal kit industry alone is said to be worth some $1.5 billion and food delivery as a whole is currently a $30 billion market. Interestingly, though, approximately $210 billion of restaurant food is eaten off-premise, making that $30 billion a small fraction of what delivery could be worth. Excluding pizza, that number shrinks even more, to just about $4 billion, or two percent of the total market.</p>

<h2>MEAL KITS</h2>
<p>Restaurant delivery has received the most funding of the bunch (at $3.2 billion), 27% higher than grocery delivery (the segment with the second-largest amount of funding). Catering received about 5% of the funding that restaurant delivery did.</p>

<p><strong>Blue Apron</strong> delivers a recipe and its required ingredients (in exactly the right proportions) directly to customers&#8217; doorsteps. The company made its initial public offering in June 2017, though it proved to be disappointing in the short-term, with one co-founder stepping down as shares sank in July. Amazon may have been at least partly to blame, crushing Blue Apron&#8217;s ambitious IPO when it announced it would make a $13.7 billion bid to acquire Whole Foods (and unveil meal kits in the process).</p>
<p><strong>Chef’d</strong> bills itself as providing a service to those who enjoy cooking, but want to save time planning meals and grocery shopping. The meal kit has received $27.53 million in three rounds from one investor (Campbell Soup Company).</p>
<p><strong>Gobble</strong> designs gourmet dinner kits (providing all the sourcing and presswork) with a slight twist. For one, ingredients are sourced locally from sustainable Bay Area farmers. Also, the company aims to provide &#8220;10-minute gourmet dinner kits with 3-step instructions,&#8221; thereby requiring minimal time and minimal cleanup.</p>
<p><strong>Tovala</strong> offers a meal subscription service and companion oven. Think of it as a meal kit on steroids: ingredients come pre-cut, marinated, and packaged, so all users have to do is pop it in their ($399, Tovala-branded) oven. The Chicago-based startup&#8217;s smart, cloud-connected oven raised $1.6 million in seed funding in 2016.</p>
<p><strong>Munchery</strong> offers same-day food delivery services (both meal kits and prepared meals) throughout the West Coast. As noted above, it&#8217;s struggled recently, though its CEO said in June that the company makes revenue from every box of food sold.</p>
<p><strong>Plated</strong> home-delivers 30-minute gourmet recipes and ingredients, similar to Blue Apron. Since being founded in 2012, Plated has gobbled up $56.4 million in eight rounds of funding from 17 investors.</p>
<p>Like others in the meal kit segment, <strong>Home Chef</strong> offers fresh ingredients and recipe delivery service. In June, the company&#8217;s CEO said it was on track to generate more than $300 million in revenue in 2017 and had received several offers of buy-outs, though it isn&#8217;t necessarily entertaining them yet.</p>
<p><strong>Green Chef</strong> promises &#8220;Fresh organic ingredients. Healthy, flavorful meals. Right at your doorstep.&#8221; In other words, a meal kit by any other name. The Colorado-based company is currently seeking to raise more funding (it&#8217;s raised $67 million thus far).</p>
<p>Spain&#8217;s answer to Blue Apron, the Madrid-based <strong>BuyFresco</strong> delivers fresh ingredients along with recipes on a weekly basis. Its most recent round of funding was in March 2015, when it raised $174,000 in venture capital.</p>
<p><strong>Freshly</strong> delivers chef-prepared, ready-made meals that take approximately three minutes to heat up. In June 2017, Nestlé led a $77 million Series C to fund Freshly’s nationwide expansion (and bringing total funding to $107 million).</p>
<p>The Berlin-based <strong>Marley Spoon</strong> is a cooking platform that offers recipes, helps its customers order seasonal ingredients. The meal kit company has partnered with celebrities in the past, releasing a line of Martha Stewart-branded kits in 2016. Along with North America, the startup operates in the Netherlands, Austria, the U.K., and Australia.</p>
<p><strong>Sun Basket</strong> is a healthy cooking service that delivers organic ingredients and customized recipes weekly to customers’ doors. Financial backers include the Tyler Florence Group and Unilever Ventures.</p>
<p>The Purple Carrot is a vegan, plant-based meal kit service. The company&#8217;s backed by a slew of VC firms as well as big names in food, like Mario Batali. In 2016, it secured $5 million in debt financing from WindSail Capital, a Boston-based investment firm focused on energy innovation and sustainability.</p>

<p><strong>OrderUp</strong> is a food delivery marketplace focused on delivering from the restaurants outside of the top metros. They provide easy access to food from locals’ favorite restaurants <span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;using restaurant delivery software&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:14465,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;10&quot;:2,&quot;14&quot;:[null,2,0],&quot;15&quot;:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;16&quot;:11}">using restaurant delivery software</span>. Headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland, with an office in New York City, OrderUp has a dual-distribution model, with some locations owned and operated by the company, and others franchised. It was acquired by Groupon in 2015.</p>
<p><strong>Postmates</strong> operates the largest on-demand delivery fleet in 40 major US metropolitan markets. In 2016, the company secured $141 million in what its founder called a &#8220;super, super difficult&#8221; fundraising effort. The round was led by Founders Fund, a San Francisco VC firm co-founded by billionaire Peter Thiel. Though Founders Fund was already a Postdates investor, it agreed to step up its support and add partner Brian Singerman to the board of directors last year.</p>
<p><strong>UberEATS</strong>is an online meal ordering and delivery platform that allows users to order restaurant delivery via a website or smartphone/tablet application. The platform is owned by Uber and launched in 2015.</p>
<p><strong>Waitr</strong> is an on-demand restaurant delivery and carryout platform based in Louisiana. So far, it&#8217;s received $10 million in funding from one investor (football player Drew Brees).</p>
<p><strong>EAT Club</strong> is based in Palo Alto and delivers food from local restaurants via mobile or web. Over the past few years, the company has shifted its focus to corporate customers like Netflix, Tesla, DogVacay, Atlassian, and Samsung.</p>
<p><strong>ChowNow</strong> is an online ordering, marketing, and customer management platform that allows restaurants to offer online ordering through their website, Facebook page, and app. The company&#8217;s received some $2 million in six funding rounds.</p>
<p><strong>EatStreet</strong> is a burgeoning online and mobile food ordering service that streamlines commerce between restaurants and diners. Founded in 2010 in Madison, Wisconsin, the company has expanded to over 15,000 restaurants in over 150 markets nationwide. In February 2017, it acquired Philadelphia delivery startup Zoomer.</p>
<p><strong>Caviar</strong> is a delivery solution for consumers to order food from local eateries with the ability to live-track the order on a map. Investors include Andreessen Horowitz and Winklevoss Capital.</p>
<p><strong>DoorDash</strong> enables small businesses to provide its customers with local delivery services (the company started with restaurant delivery). It&#8217;s received at least $186.7 million in five rounds of funding from investors like Sequoia Capital and Y Combinator.</p>
<p>Berlin-based <strong>Delivery Hero</strong> is a network of online food ordering sites with over 100 restaurant partners worldwide. It&#8217;s made 13 acquisitions in its history, including foodpanda, Yemeksepeti (a Turkish company), and ClickDelivery.</p>
<p><strong>Just Eat</strong> provides convenient and easy access to a huge variety of delivery restaurants and order food online. The British company has made 15 acquisitions and went public in 2014.</p>
<p><strong>iFood</strong> is a mobile platform in Latin America wherein customers can find and order food from restaurants. The Brazilian company has received more than $98 million in funding.</p>
<p><strong>Deliveroo</strong> is a technology company that focuses on marketing, selling, and delivering restaurant meals to the household or office. It acquired Maple in 2017.</p>
<p><strong>GrubHub</strong> allows users to find and order food from restaurants in their vicinity that deliver or offer pickup, via an app and a website. It went public in April 2014 and, in August 2017, acquired Eat24 for some $287.5 million — roughly twice what Yelp paid to acquire it just two years ago, in a $134 million deal.</p>
<p>In addition to offering digitally based customer engagement services, <strong>tillster</strong> specializes in loyalty &amp; self-service ordering for QSR, fast-casual &amp; casual dining industries. It acquired Snap finger, a restaurant search and remote ordering site for take-out, delivery and catering, in 2013.</p>
<p><strong>Clustertruck</strong> is a provider of food delivery services. The company operates a food truck to prepare food on the go and deliver it to the customers who order food using the company&#8217;s own mobile application. In 2016 it closed on a $1 million round of funding to fuel new locations.</p>
<p><strong>Ando</strong> is a delivery-only restaurant based in New York and run by Momofuku&#8217;s David Chang. The company has received funding from a number of big-name investors, including actor Aziz Ansar and Jimmy Fallon.</p>

<h2>THE FUTURE OF FOOD DELIVERY</h2>
<p>Ordering food online isn&#8217;t exactly new (Seamless, for instance, has been around since 1999), but it still has quite a way to go. Currently, online food delivery touts just one-fifth the penetration of e-commerce, which does 10% of its sales online. The companies above (and those who&#8217;ve poured millions into their coffers) hope to change that. Morgan Stanley analysts believe that, ultimately, the entire $210 billion of food eaten off-premise food is up for grabs. So there&#8217;s more to come — but there isn&#8217;t room for everyone. In fact, some have predicted that as many as half of the meal kit companies currently on the market will die off following Amazon&#8217;s acquisition of Whole Foods. The question remains, who will take the biggest remaining chunk?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Human nature is a funny thing. It&#8217;s what propels people to fixate on earning points. As kids, we&#8217;re rewarded with gold stars — often completing our homework for the reward more than anything else. Not much changes as we grow older — though the gold stars are swapped with points, with people opting to be loyal to one airline, one hotel chain, or one restaurant simply to earn points (even if it means paying more). Enter restaurant loyalty programs, which have long been proven (like similar programs in the airline and hotel industry) to drive sales and create repeat customers.</p>
<p>For a restaurant, the goals of such a program are two-fold: While they offer guest incentives, restaurant loyalty programs also gather information about those guests in the process. The result is value not only for the guest, but for the chain itself. And yet, some of the largest foodservice chains in the world still aren&#8217;t on board with loyalty. McDonald&#8217;s is reportedly developing a loyalty program, though it hasn&#8217;t yet made any formal announcements. Whole Foods is also currently testing a program in select markets, though it isn&#8217;t yet widely available.</p>
<p>Those who&#8217;ve excelled have done so by ensuring their loyalty program offers something of value to both the company and its customers, and evolving to meet consumer demand. Savvy companies (particularly those that think strategically) are even looking beyond traditional rewards, attempting to solve customer problems and soothe pain points and occasionally even carving out a new niche in the process. Below, we highlight a handful of companies who’ve used loyalty programs successfully, along with some compelling restaurant loyalty stats, for those who still aren’t quite convinced.</p>
<h2>At Starbucks, Loyalty Drives Transaction Frequency</h2>
<p>With 12 million members in the U.S. alone, the Starbucks loyalty program is a well-known success story. The coffee giant launched the “My Starbucks Rewards Loyalty Program” in 2010. Comps accelerated shortly after, with the company calling the program &#8220;an overwhelming success&#8221; that drove both transaction frequency and average ticket size.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s evolved in the years since, most notably to include a digital ordering component known as Mobile Order &amp; Pay (offered only to loyalty members). Loyalty programs have demonstrated the most effectiveness when integrated into digital payment and ordering — which reinforces ease of use — and Starbucks is no exception. In 2016, it was reported that the company&#8217;s loyalty program held more money than some banks, with $1.2 billion in customer funds loaded onto plastic and mobile Starbucks cards as of the first quarter of the year. According to company filings, that number is now over $2 billion and has more than doubled in just two years (data shows the chain saw $621 million in funds loaded to the program in 2014).</p>
<p>Success hasn&#8217;t come without some blowback, however. The increased use of mobile-order-and-pay has caused friction between the chain and its employees, who argue Starbucks stores are not equipped to handle the increased volume brought on by the popularity of the loyalty program and its mobile order option, which has led to congestion in pick-up areas. Though mobile transactions spiked throughout U.S. stores in the most recent quarter, with 1,200 locations experiencing a 20% jump in mobile transactions, the increase in volume caused some customers to leave without making purchases. Starbucks is now aiming to address that with a revamp of its store designs and is currently testing a dedicated mobile order and pay-only store at its Seattle headquarters.</p>

<p>Since launching rewards program My Panera in 2012, the chain now touts the largest such program in the industry, at 25 million members. Currently, half of all transactions come via the program, which relies heavily on an investment in <a href="https://aaronallen.com/blog/restaurant-tech-investment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">technology and operations</a>.</p>

<p>Panera recently reported digital sales of more than $1 billion annually made via mobile, web or kiosk — a number projected to double in 2019. President Blaine Hurst has said that the success lies in the chain&#8217;s blend of digital innovation and &#8220;operational integrity,&#8221; which ultimately &#8220;translates to the kinds of sales we’re seeing today.”</p>
<p>By the numbers:</p>
<p>• More than 25 million members (which would equate to nearly 8% of the U.S. population)<br />
• As of Q1 2017, sales from mobile, web, and kiosks represented 26% of total company sales</p>
<h2>The Palm Rewards Diners in True High-End Fashion</h2>
<p>Like most restaurant loyalty programs, The Palm&#8217;s 837 Club rewards guests who return to the restaurant again and again. The difference, however, is that diners must pay to participate — a one-time fee of $25. The points redeemed, however, generate higher rewards than at other chains.</p>
<p>As it&#8217;s a fine-dining restaurant, users can redeem points for everything from complimentary desserts to weekend getaways, and receive invites to members-only events. In the twenty years since it was launched, the program has evolved, to offer more exclusive rewards and promotions for continued patronage. But despite the continual changes, the club remains in line with The Palm&#8217;s brand. As a high-end steakhouse, it makes sense that regulars would be treated to things like three-pound lobsters on their birthday or gift cards to Tiffany.</p>
<h2>Subway Evolves Beyond the Punch Card to Address Sales Slump</h2>
<p>Gone are the days of the &#8220;Buy Ten Subs, Get One Free&#8221; punch card. Subway&#8217;s loyalty program has evolved considerably over the years. The Subcard eventually became a Subcard app, complete with geotargeted promotions as well as custom sandwich-builder and calorie calculator features. And it isn&#8217;t just for U.S. diners. Subcard holders can also earn their way to free food with every purchase at Subway stores across UK and Ireland. In 2015, the sandwich chain began testing a link between its loyalty program and access to in-store Wi-Fi, offering customers in some Canadian Subway locations a free sandwich if they logged into the in-store Wi-Fi network.</p>

<p>Recently, the chain&#8217;s been looking to its app (and technology in general) to correct a sales slump. In January, Subway announced it would be introducing touch-screen ordering kiosks and a new mobile app (a bid to catch up with rivals like Panera) and, in a move straight from the Starbucks playbook, said it was also moving away from its five-decade-old format, by testing dedicated pickup areas for mobile orders. A newly revamped mobile app, introduced earlier this year, now includes a sandwich-customizing feature and is available in roughly 26,000 of the chain’s 27,000 U.S. stores.</p>
<p>By the numbers:</p>
<p>• The chain&#8217;s app garnered top place among quick-serve restaurant loyalty programs<br />
• &#8220;Very satisfied&#8221; rating for the program rose 31% between 2014 and 2015</p>
<h2>Dunkin&#8217; Donuts Saw Ticket Size Increase as a Result of Its Rewards</h2>
<p>The DD Perks Rewards Program was launched in January 2014 as a way to reward guests with points toward free beverages for every visit they make. Three years later, the program now touts more than six million members nationwide. The use of the rewards program, and the chain&#8217;s continued emphasis on digital, appears to be leading to larger ticket sizes.</p>
<p>In the second quarter of 2016, Dunkin&#8217; Donuts posted 0.5% growth in US same-store sales. Sales were down from 2.8% a year prior, but there was a bright side: though it saw decreased traffic, the chain noted rising average ticket size was driving same-store sales. Loyalty programs have been shown to increase a customer&#8217;s lifetime value by 30% or more through increased visit frequency and spend per visit.</p>

<p>By the numbers:</p>
<p>• More than 6 million members<br />
• On-the-Go ordering (offered only to loyalty members) was close to 2% of total sales during the first quarter of 2017</p>
<h2>Chipotle Went from 0 to 3.1 Million Loyalty Members in 3 Months</h2>

<p>Chipotle&#8217;s loyalty program was largely a move to get the chain on the right track after a widely reported food safety scandal. Many decried the sudden rollout of a rewards program which was launched quickly, only lasted three months, and didn&#8217;t appear to make any dent in terms of customer perception. But the program did provide some value to the chain, however short-lived it may have been.</p>
<p>The three-month &#8220;Chiptopia&#8221; program launched July 1, 2016. By the end of that month, the program already had more than 3.6 million participants and accounted for 30% of all transactions. At the end of the program, Chipotle said it had more than 3.1 million customers register and use their Chiptopia cards, with 85,000 participants visiting at least 11 times each month over the three months. Whether it won back lost customers, however, remains to be seen.</p>
<p>By the numbers:</p>
<p>• More than 3.1 million members in three months<br />
• Chiptopia accounted for 30% of all transactions within its first month</p>
<h2>The Restaurant Loyalty Program Space Continues to Grow</h2>
<p>There&#8217;s already an incredible amount of funding flowing into the loyalty space. MOGL, an online cash back service for dining at affiliated restaurants, has at least $44.94 million as a result of four rounds of funding from investors like Avalon Ventures and Sigma Partners. POS loyalty platform FiveStars underwent a $50 million funding round in 2016. LevelUp, a mobile payment platform that lets users accept mobile payments and engage with customers through loyalty programs, has an estimated $98 million in funding under its belt. Belly, which aims to &#8220;help businesses enhance digital connections to strengthen customer loyalty,&#8221; has $25.6 million. There are a slew of other companies in the restaurant loyalty space, too: Thanx, Perkville, Dealyze, Brink, and Paytronix among them.</p>
<p>As more loyalty providers enter the space (and, as chains begin to measure the success of their own programs), the programs will gain effectiveness. So, not only are loyalty programs impacting the restaurant industry currently — the way they do so will continue to evolve.</p>

<p>Already, many chains are incorporating gamification into their programs — offering rewards to those who complete a quiz or play a game (and collecting customer data in the process). While it might seem like a blip on the radar, games have eclipsed some of the largest social media sites in terms of daily users. Remember the Pokémon Go craze? At its height, the game surpassed Twitter in daily active users and eclipsed Facebook in engagement.</p>
<h2>Restaurant Loyalty Programs Offer the Most Value to Those Who Think Strategically</h2>
<p>Rewards drive the majority of the population — parting with our hard-earned money isn&#8217;t always easy, but getting rewarded for it lessens the blow. And, as it turns out, generally leads us to spend more. According to a 2016 report, 66% of consumers modify the amount they spend to maximize points — buying more and spending more than non-loyalty members (and resulting in a 5% &#8211; 10% revenue increase, on average).</p>
<p>The typical household owned an average of 13 loyalty cards in 2016, but the majority of these cards was inactive, highlighting the importance of ensuring a program is a strong fit for the chain.</p>
<p>As restaurants look to gain a competitive advantage, loyalty programs will continue to greatly expand. But chains can&#8217;t expect to launch a loyalty program and immediately see their revenue increase. While the benefits vary among each business, those who roll them out without a proper amount of strategic planning or foresight won&#8217;t reap the same benefits. Those who undertake the analysis required to launch such an important project will reap the largest rewards. The secret sauce will lie not just in increasing sales in the short-term, but in better understanding what a chain&#8217;s ideal customer looks like: when they come in, what they buy, and how much they spend.</p>
