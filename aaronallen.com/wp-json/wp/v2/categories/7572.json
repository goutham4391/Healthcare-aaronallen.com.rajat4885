{"id":7572,"count":24,"description":"Restaurant investment has been increasingly common with the highest amount of capital available in history. Foodservice companies are increasingly becoming a target for private equity and other investors.\r\n\r\nChains are continuing to grow through acquisitions. In 2018, revenue growth among publicly traded foodservice companies in the U.S. amounted to $8.1b, with inorganic growth (that through acquisitions) accounting for 28% of the increase. There are also still several public restaurant companies expected to go private (more have gone private than public in recent years).\r\n\r\nIn these insights, we cover all things restaurant investment, including acquisitions, mergers, divestitures, and provide some guidance as to how to value your business, what is needed to move forward with a sale, and how the investment process looks overall. A creative and modernized investment thesis, due diligence, and custom market landscape insights are requisite for an acquisition and expansion strategy that leapfrogs the competition.","link":"https:\/\/aaronallen.com\/blog\/restaurant-investment","name":"Restaurant Investment","slug":"restaurant-investment","taxonomy":"category","parent":1,"meta":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v19.2 (Yoast SEO v19.6) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Restaurant Investment Insights from Aaron Allen &amp; Associates<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Restaurant investment has been increasingly common with the highest amount of capital available in history.
