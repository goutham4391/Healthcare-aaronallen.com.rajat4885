There are several components of successful marketing strategies. This isn\u2019t an all-inclusive list, but some top strategic restaurant marketing issues include:<\/span><\/p><ul><li><strong>Restaurant Branding<\/strong>:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/aaronallen.com\/blog\/restaurant-brand-audit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A brand is a promise<\/a>.\u00a0 It\u2019s what customers, employees (Internal Customers), vendors, the media and all other key constituents come to expect in dealing with your restaurant. Brand-building is closing the gap between what you promise and what you deliver. A strong brand is one that has alignment between the promise and execution.\u00a0 It\u2019s not something that happens when you advertise, and it\u2019s not that people recognize your logo or recall your advertising.<\/li><li><strong>Positioning<\/strong>: Positioning is the place you hold in the customers&#8217; or prospects&#8217; mind relative to the competition (the cheaper choice, the higher quality choice, etc.). Effective positioning involves incorporating your Unique Selling Proposition (USP) The USP is the one thing that only you can claim.\u00a0 It\u2019s a point of differentiation that the competition either cannot or does not claim. An example is Burger King versus McDonald\u2019s. If Burger King can convince you that a flame-broiled burger tastes better than a fried burger, they\u2019ve won the war because McDonald\u2019s will never go into all 38k stores globally to install char-grilling pits.<\/li><li><strong>Restaurant Market Research<\/strong>: Marketing doesn\u2019t happen in a vacuum.\u00a0 Effective marketing must be built on a foundation of fact and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/aaronallen.com\/restaurant-research\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">knowledge about the market<\/a>, your competition, your customers, your internal customers, financial history, marketing history, the industry, and outside forces that will impact your business.\u00a0 Nobody can afford to market to everyone all the time, so effective market research and due diligence can help you be more effective in your marketing efforts.<\/li><li><strong>Menu Engineering<\/strong>: The\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/aaronallen.com\/blog\/menu-strategy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">menu is the single most important piece of marketing in a restaurant<\/a>. Every six to twelve months, you\u2019ll want to conduct an analysis of your menu. This will include profitability analysis and a competitive restaurant menu analysis. To keep your menu fresh, relevant, and profitable, you\u2019ll need to know specifically how each item on your menu is performing and also how it stacks up next to your top competition. Think of each item on your menu as a tenant leasing space and it has to earn its right to the space you\u2019ve granted it.<\/li><li><strong>Training as part of Restaurant Marketing<\/strong>: It\u2019s also a good idea to include a marketing component in your training program so that you have a staff of ambassadors to help your sales-building efforts.<\/li><li><strong>Marketing Budget for Restaurants<\/strong>: Based on franchisee contributions to marketing, most restaurants stay within a marketing budget range between 2.6% and 7.6% depending on the category. Some are trying harder to leverage marketing and assign up to 60% more than the average for the category.<\/li><\/ul><p><a href=\"https:\/\/aaronallen.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Top-quartile-allocating-significantly-more-to-restaurant-marketing-spend-.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16014\" src=\"https:\/\/aaronallen.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Top-quartile-allocating-significantly-more-to-restaurant-marketing-spend-.png\" alt=\"Top quartile allocating significantly more to restaurant marketing spend\" width=\"2358\" height=\"1560\" srcset=\"https:\/\/11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Top-quartile-allocating-significantly-more-to-restaurant-marketing-spend-.png 2358w, https:\/\/11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Top-quartile-allocating-significantly-more-to-restaurant-marketing-spend--350x232.png 350w, https:\/\/11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Top-quartile-allocating-significantly-more-to-restaurant-marketing-spend--300x198.png 300w, https:\/\/11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Top-quartile-allocating-significantly-more-to-restaurant-marketing-spend--1024x677.png 1024w, https:\/\/11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Top-quartile-allocating-significantly-more-to-restaurant-marketing-spend--768x508.png 768w, https:\/\/11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Top-quartile-allocating-significantly-more-to-restaurant-marketing-spend--1536x1016.png 1536w, https:\/\/11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Top-quartile-allocating-significantly-more-to-restaurant-marketing-spend--2048x1355.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2358px) 100vw, 2358px\" \/><\/a><\/p><div>\u00a0<\/div>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-64fb904 elementor-widget elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"64fb904\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">Types of Restaurant Marketing<\/h2>\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-60703c8 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"60703c8\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<p>There a myriad of different tactics that can be employed for a successful restaurant marketing strategy.

Affiliates typically get 5-15% of revenue from the sales they generate. Affiliate marketing\u00a0allows the company to get to a broader audience with a performance-based spend. Affiliates can improve the company\u2019s reputation (\u201creputation by association\u201d).<\/p><p>One case study of this is when delivery platform Caviar was paying a commission of 8% to its affiliates. With annual orders per customer estimated at at least $140\/year, and an average order size of $30, the return on investment could reach 58x (sales-to-investment ratio, conservatively).<\/p><h3>Article Marketing for Restaurants<\/h3><p>A branch of content marketing, article marketing consists of publishing articles to advertise the business. It can be done both online and offline. One of the biggest benefits of article or content marketing is that it is a relatively inexpensive way to promote a business and allows companies to increase brand awareness and SEO visibility that improves the website rank.<\/p><p>Starbucks, for instance, has a \u201cstories\u201d section on its website, where articles are published covering the community, social impact, and coffee.<\/p><h3>Behavioral Marketing for Restaurants<\/h3><p>This includes studying people\u2019s behavior and developing advertising and offers based on it. Ads can be targeted to predefined categories such as geolocation, new\/repeated visitor, past purchases, occasion. Primarily for restaurants, behavioral marketing would be focused on increasing frequency and\/or check size.<\/p><h3>Cause Marketing for Restaurants<\/h3><p>Supporting a good cause and advertising about it helps rally support for the cause while also creates awareness for the brand. One of the biggest benefits of cause marketing is having a positive impact on brand loyalty, employee engagement, and press coverage. It can also generate new visits.<\/p><p>In 2015, sweetgreen embraced the cause of food waste.

Endorsements need to be targeted carefully, there needs to be a considerable overlap between the celebrity\u2019s audience and the brand.<\/p><p>As the \u201cdestiny\u201d of the brand and celebrity are somehow tied together, there\u2019s also a risk involved for the brand on the break of scandals (for instance, Subway and Jared were very closely aligned, so negative press on Jared personally reflected poorly on the brand overall).<\/p><h3>Channel Marketing for Restaurants<\/h3><p>The target is to provide the customer with a seamlessly integrated experience through different alternative means: digital via mobile devices, computers, social networks, web, e-mail, digital media, gaming platforms, and in-store, via the point of sale, or traditional channels such as TV and print. This enables companies to grow their customer base and improve lifetime value.<\/p><h3>Cooperative Marketing for Restaurants<\/h3><p>Companies partner in marketing a jointly-developed product or their complementary products. This resource sharing can help bring in an audience that is unique to each of the partners and increase sales for everyone involved.<\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/aaronallen.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Cooperative-Marketing-for-Restaurants.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16019\" src=\"https:\/\/aaronallen.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Cooperative-Marketing-for-Restaurants.png\" alt=\"Cooperative Marketing for Restaurants\" width=\"2082\" height=\"630\" srcset=\"https:\/\/11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Cooperative-Marketing-for-Restaurants.png 2082w, https:\/\/11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Cooperative-Marketing-for-Restaurants-350x106.png 350w, https:\/\/11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Cooperative-Marketing-for-Restaurants-300x91.png 300w, https:\/\/11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Cooperative-Marketing-for-Restaurants-1024x310.png 1024w, https:\/\/11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Cooperative-Marketing-for-Restaurants-768x232.png 768w, https:\/\/11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Cooperative-Marketing-for-Restaurants-1536x465.png 1536w, https:\/\/11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Cooperative-Marketing-for-Restaurants-2048x620.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2082px) 100vw, 2082px\" \/><\/a><\/p><h3>Influencer Marketing<\/h3><p>This is a type of social media marketing that focuses on convincing a few influential people in a market so that they endorse the product or service and ultimately spread the word to a broader audience.<\/p><p>In 2012 McDonald\u2019s recruited mom bloggers to promote a healthier happy meal (smaller fries portions and fruit snacks). They chose moms because they are customers and many of them have loyal followings (either blogging or in social media channels). They were given privileged access \u201dbehind the scenes\u201d and perks.

Unfortunately, in restaurant chains most marketing departments haven&#8217;t seen a thorough upgrade since 2009: the equivalent of walking around with an iPhone 3G in your pocket. These are some of the restaurant marketing ideas and trends affecting the effectiveness of marketing campaigns in the last few years.<\/p><h3>An Example of How Marketing Has Shifted: Psychographics Versus Demographics<\/h3><p>Understanding this simple truth is key to unlocking a distinguished and differentiated appeal (that translates into outsized market share and enterprise value growth). Almost every restaurant chain can compete in terms of price (at least one loss-leading day of the week), and every restaurant promises good food and quality service.<\/p><p>But to really harness a brand\u2019s full potential, chains must dig deeper to understand intent, not just assumed behavior or predisposition (e.g. psychographics over demographics is one of the <a style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\" href=\"https:\/\/aaronallen.com\/restaurant-trends\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">trends affecting restaurants<\/a>). Sentiment and intent are often lost in antiquated attempts at audience segmentation analysis. In other words, see them for how they see themselves (and communicate definitively where their values and those of your brand intersect).<\/p><h3>Restaurant Marketing Ideas and Case Studies: Chipotle&#8217;s Love Story (or Competitor Loathing)<\/h3><p>The Scarecrow was one of the best pieces of marketing in restaurants that has ever been produced, in our view. It worked on so many levels \u2013 not just the innovation. You could watch that just for the entertainment value, and also if you were an activist pushing for change in the food industry enjoy while taking away some of the deeper meaning that reflected the positive characteristics of the brand promise, the notion of \u201cFood with Integrity,\u201d and Chipotle\u2019s role of pushing that agenda and its cause forward.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-e70d0bd elementor-widget elementor-widget-html\" data-id=\"e70d0bd\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"html.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t<iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/98800121\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/98800121\"><\/a>\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-83c5e2d elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"83c5e2d\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<p>The story was centered on what Chipotle believes \u2013 and what we all believe \u2013 about the modern food system and how it could be better. The message was about something bigger than a company and the cold corporate pursuits of ever more productivity and profitability no matter the price. We all saw Chipotle in the hero and it endeared us evermore to the brand. We took Chipotle\u2019s cause up as our own and cheerfully paid whatever price it needed to keep doing good and helping to change our global food system for the better.<\/p><p>That\u2019s really the notion of a brand: a promise around a shared set of beliefs that others are both attracted by and want to enroll in helping advance. \u00a0<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-18f8d56 elementor-widget elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"18f8d56\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">Best Practices<\/h2>\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-23f3fb3 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"23f3fb3\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<p>There are all kinds of rules of thumb that can be applied to successfully market a restaurant, including:\u00a0<\/p><h3>Restaurant Marketing Budgets<\/h3><p>Based on franchisee contributions, the largest chains allocate an average 3.9% of sales to marketing. Quick-service restaurants are the category with the highest average spend, allocating a median of 4.6% of sales to marketing efforts. Casual dining is at 3.5%, and fast-casual restaurants at 3% of marketing spend.\u00a0 Though this data is specific to large chains in the U.S., we\u2019ve seen similar numbers across numerous clients globally.<\/p><p>As the battle for diners intensifies, top restaurant chains are paying even closer attention to their marketing efforts. Some of the largest pizza chains \u2014 such as Papa John\u2019s, Domino\u2019s, and Little Caesars \u2014 have the heaviest spend, reaching more than 6% of sales.<\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/aaronallen.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Pizza-marketing-spend-highest-among-QSR-restaurants.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16021\" src=\"https:\/\/aaronallen.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Pizza-marketing-spend-highest-among-QSR-restaurants.png\" alt=\"Pizza marketing spend highest among QSR restaurants\" width=\"2358\" height=\"1562\" srcset=\"https:\/\/11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Pizza-marketing-spend-highest-among-QSR-restaurants.png 2358w, https:\/\/11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Pizza-marketing-spend-highest-among-QSR-restaurants-350x232.png 350w, https:\/\/11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Pizza-marketing-spend-highest-among-QSR-restaurants-300x199.png 300w, https:\/\/11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Pizza-marketing-spend-highest-among-QSR-restaurants-1024x678.png 1024w, https:\/\/11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Pizza-marketing-spend-highest-among-QSR-restaurants-768x509.png 768w, https:\/\/11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Pizza-marketing-spend-highest-among-QSR-restaurants-1536x1017.png 1536w, https:\/\/11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Pizza-marketing-spend-highest-among-QSR-restaurants-2048x1357.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2358px) 100vw, 2358px\" \/><\/a><\/p><p>The allocation of restaurant franchisee contributions to marketing also varies across segments. Coffee\/bakery systems have the lowest rates, with franchisees adding an average of 2.6% of sales to corporate coffers, while pizza franchisees contribute an average of 6.5% of sales.<\/p><p>It\u2019s also a good idea to allocate this money proportionally to your sales volume.\u00a0 Meaning, if July is your busiest month, you should spend a proportionate amount on your restaurant&#8217;s marketing budget in that month.\u00a0 Fish where the fish are biting.\u00a0 Some restaurant owners look at slow periods and think that\u2019s when they need to spend money to drive sales, so they spend a big chunk of cash trying to build a happy hour business and forgo building on top of their busy periods.\u00a0<\/p><p>Fact is, there is a reason people aren\u2019t coming in from 3:00 PM\u20135:00 PM and you\u2019ll be sending valuable marketing dollars down a black hole if you try to build this period.\u00a0 There are nearly one million restaurants in the United States and probably only 2% of them are busy from 3:00 PM\u20135:00 PM.\u00a0Marketing can\u2019t change behavior; it can only influence existing behaviors.\u00a0 Spend your marketing dollar where it will have the best return for your restaurant.<\/p><h3>New Trial vs. Frequency, Check Average, and Party Size<\/h3><p>For restaurant chains, the majority (somewhere in the range of 80%\u201390%) of the marketing budget is spent against new trial: getting new customers to visit for the first time.\u00a0 This is the least effective place to spend your money. Most new trial efforts are spent against mass media advertising, which is costly and has a dismal return on investment.\u00a0 New customer acquisition is 7\u201310 times more expensive than building restaurant sales through increased frequency, check average and party size.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><h3>How to Measure the Effectiveness of Marketing in Your Restaurant<\/h3><p>If you cannot prove the dollars you spend persuade people to do business with you, you should not advertise.\u00a0 If you can\u2019t see a direct relationship between marketing and increased sales, your marketing isn\u2019t working. Marketing campaigns need to have measurable results.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-d76a761 elementor-widget elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"d76a761\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">Be Different, Not Just Better<\/h2>\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-ce88e21 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"ce88e21\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<p>Regardless of age, income, education, culture, race, or background, we are all conditioned to notice what\u2019s different.
