Brands that can hire, train, and retain frontline employees to bring their brands to life are going to win.\u201d As they\u2019ve done before, Darden saw the writing on the wall. The company has outperformed the casual dining sector on the whole in the last decade.<\/p><p>And while there\u2019s been a lot of lip service relative to casual dining and service levels,\u00a0in particular, there hasn\u2019t been a dramatic improvement with regard to training to address the issues this category is facing. In fact, there\u2019s been quite a bit of pulling back relative to these initiatives, as they\u2019re seen as more of a cost than an investment which can provide returns through enhanced labor efficiency, improved employee retention,\u00a0reduced breakage, stronger service levels, reduced customer attrition, and so on.<\/p><p>The rising cost of labor can actually (arguably) be a good thing for the industry overall and economies in the longer term. The result will be not only greater emphasis on engineering more efficient unit economic models, labor models, and productivity improvements \u2014 these efforts will also be benefited by a wide variety of exciting new tools that have not yet been adapted to or adopted by the foodservice industry. This presents a\u00a0tremendous opportunity for investors, technologists, and future-looking operators focusing on bold bets to transform adversity into advantage.<\/p><h4>Implications for Restaurants:<\/h4><ul><li>Companies who make investments in productivity improvements will leapfrog their competition<\/li><li>Improved compensation can help offset turnover (which costs the U.S. restaurant industry an estimated $95b annually)<\/li><li>Technological advancements benefitting limited-service more, initially, to offset labor costs, followed by full-service operators making investments in modernizing training and enhancing relevance<\/li><\/ul><h2>People and Purpose Become More Valuable (Again)<\/h2><p>Sometimes a parrot can repeat a phrase it has heard many times with an astonishing resemblance to how it heard it said before.

(Many have called to ask us how \u2014 and delivery companies have asked for our help, too \u2014 but easy gains often feed the hubris that precedes humility.)<\/p><h4>Implications for Restaurants:<\/h4><ul><li>Aggregators aggregating: the history of travel and hotel aggregators will serve as a benchmark for some of what will happen with restaurant delivery today<\/li><li>There will be an evolution of the business model (both on the side of the delivery platforms and the companies using them) which will happen on an accelerated timeframe<\/li><li>Even more Amazon\/Whole Foods implications here, and the possibilities from other combinations are nearly endless (think about a potential combination between self-driving cars and navigation services, and the ability to deliver fresh ingredients or fully prepared meals with nothing more than the push of a button, or via voice ordering, or the convenience of a sweet-yet-sophisticated robot that anticipates your desires and acts without even articulating them explicitly)<\/li><\/ul><h2>Alternative Proteins Claim Capital<\/h2><p>It will be a few years yet before alternative proteins gain so much ground that it scares the establishment, but smart money is already making bets (including incumbents putting corporate venture capital to work by investing early in \u2014 and shaping the future of \u2014 companies that could one day grow into rivals). The plant protein market is expected to grow 6.6% annually, reaching nearly $19 billion by 2026. Some companies investing in this sector include Tyson (with a stake in Beyond Meat), General Mills (Beyond Meat, Urban Remedy, Farmhouse Culture), PepsiCo (Health Warrior, Bare Foods), Nestle (Wildscape), and restaurant chains including White Castle, FatBurger, and Umami Burger partnering with Impossible Foods. Beyond Meat filed for the first IPO in its category, expected to take place in 2019 for $100 million.<\/p><p>We\u2019ll still eat a lot more chicken than crickets in 2019, so don\u2019t take this forecast as a silly and commercially unviable suggestion that the average operator try jumping on a bandwagon that\u2019s still being built and lab-tested; nor a prediction that Q3\u2019s hottest menu promotion will be what scientists in lab coats are working on today.<\/p><p>But with that said, there is a movement toward greater sustainability. There has to be. Agricultural production simply can\u2019t keep up with population growth. Between water shortages, arable land decreases, species depletion and extinction, climate change and volatility (whether you believe in the politically-charged reasons or not, the impact to crops and food supply, when there is a drought or massive storms is clear), there will be more attention toward ecologically conscious proteins.<\/p><h4>Implications for Restaurants:<\/h4><ul><li>Lab-grown meats, insect-based proteins, 3D-printed foods, vertical farms, urban and pirate gardens, and more will begin to be included in conversations for the future of the industry (in the next few years, they will become competitors for share of stomach)<\/li><li>What may seem or sound like military-only applications now will move toward commercial markets (it\u2019s easy to forget that the French government incentivized inventors to develop a cheap and effective way of preserving large amounts of food to help feed Napoleon\u2019s Army and this led to the invention of jarring and canning)<\/li><\/ul>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-ffe67f6 elementor-widget-divider--view-line elementor-widget elementor-widget-divider\" data-id=\"ffe67f6\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"divider.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t<style>\/*!

In the U.S., the population in large cities has grown three times faster than the rest of the country over the last seven years. People moving back to the cities is leading to costs increasing faster than low-wage foodservice workers can afford right at a time when operators need them most.<\/p><p>Urbanization will support frontier markets becoming relevant globally, and companies will find it to be increasingly complex when assessing whether and how to expand into these markets. Developing markets will also become more relevant over the next decade, as they\u2019ll account for ~60% of the population and nearly two-thirds of global GDP.<\/p><p>Just as restaurants (casual-dining chains, in particular) followed the population migration over the last few decades to the suburbs, where lower rents afforded larger footprints, the projected changes in the population distribution will lead to new formats. Delivery-only concepts that don\u2019t require prime real estate will become increasingly popular, and new profit centers will be born to accommodate the changes.<\/p><h4>Implications for Restaurants:<\/h4><ul><li>Large restaurant brands will look toward fast-growing markets and develop customized entry strategies and will need to keep in mind <a href=\"https:\/\/aaronallen.com\/blog\/restaurant-brand-identity-crisis\">brand translation<\/a>\u00a0and regional competition<\/li><li>As new formats meet new times, dark kitchen concepts will increase in prevalence; their enhanced scalability will help to reach levels of growth that were previously deemed impossible for restaurants<\/li><li>In many geographies (China and the U.S., in particular), large cities are reaching a saturation point, prompting a shift of focus to mid-sized cities<\/li><\/ul><h2>The Smart Get Smarter<\/h2><p>It\u2019s not just about analytics, KPIs, graduate degrees, continuing education, those \u201csmart carts\u201d at the airport, and city bikes in traffic-congested municipalities.

They share more in common with the adventurous sea captains of yesterday than the aristocracy.\u00a0 They recognize that they are responsible to and for a great many. They have not made it to the top so much as they have been entrusted with the fates of the many they serve (shareholders and stakeholders; companies and communities; a profession and trade; the lives and legacies of themselves and all else who place their trust in them).<\/p><p>Modern CEOs left firm ground long ago, and now captain boats that must navigate not just choppy seas and a surging or receding tide, but also romance temperamental financiers, harness the finicky winds in predictable ways, inspire and communicate with a sometimes distrusting crew, and chart dangerous new waters in pursuit of fertile ground to plant flags and grow crops; and return all the fruits of this labor and risk safely, to deliver both handsome profits and healthy sailors (as flawlessly and with the flair of a master magician\u2019s best trick).<\/p><p>It\u2019s nearly as overwhelming as the human spirit is resilient and resourceful. All throughout time \u2014 across geographies, cultures, and dispositions \u2014 humankind has endured and overcome difficult situations and circumstances. Today is no different, except \u2014 with acknowledgment to the exception that has always been true \u2014 the challenges of today are new and more, well, challenging. They require more ingenuity, passion, commitment, and those wonderfully human characteristics of the human spirit. Faithful, optimistic, undaunted, and determined to make improvements for themselves and others in the service of a greater good.<\/p><p>Today, that requires factoring in the calculus of global markets and competition, outsmarting the machines we built to outsmart us, digging even deeper for both the motivation and inspiration to contribute (to wider society, closer constituencies, and even the global tribe) in a way that is memorable and meaningful.<\/p><h2>So, As To What You Should Expect For Restaurant Trends 2019?<\/h2><p>More of the same. More intensified.<\/p><p>Some will put in valiant efforts and advance us all forward in ways we could not have previously imagined. And, sure, others will freeload, frustrate, and seek enrichment in unfair (even despicable) ways. There will be good days and bad days; awful people and awesome people. Some days we will feel the lightbulb go off, and some days it would seem someone intentionally shot the lights out.<\/p><p>But, for certain, you can count on 2019 moving faster than 2018. For life to be both more complex and simplified. For work to be more challenging and rewarding. For some service experiences that make you want to pull your hair out and some that make you want to hug someone and express just how much you appreciate them, their effort, and what impact they had on you and your life.<\/p><p>And, you can also bet that those companies that invest more in their people, systems, products, corporate purpose, the best advisors, and thoughtfully-constructed plans, will outperform those that didn\u2019t. More to the point, for the hospitality industry (and by extension foodservice, travel, retail, and service businesses) that put the crew first (put themselves wholeheartedly in the service of being in the service of others) will not only grow faster and farther, they will help bring us all to a better place; lavished with the prizes because of the higher calling of the endeavor and not just the elusively fat profits a faux contributor falsely presumes.<\/p><h2>What Does It All Mean?<\/h2><p>The spectrum of challenges and opportunities of the foodservice industry of the future cannot be seen with only a microscopic nor macroscopic lens; it requires both, plus a telescope and an operator with the ability to quickly change the direction and focus of view without getting vertigo. It can be helpful to use the buddy system and use your judgment on what to target and when to pull the trigger while having a spotter to help analyze the conditions and hone your aim.<\/p><p>There\u2019s a natural tendency to think like lab rats \u2014 going about life as normal and oblivious to what the scientists are working on until confronted with something that disrupts a comfortable routine. We\u2019re living as part of a generation that will witness more modern marvels than any other in history. The majority of our population has always lived in an era where both TV and radio existed, so it\u2019s easy to forget that it took decades between those inventions, which were both quantum leaps in technology.<\/p><p>Over the last ten years, there have been mostly incremental changes made with regard to our day-to-day lives. The same will not be said ten years from now.<\/p><h2>Some Things to Keep in Mind Heading Into 2019<\/h2><p>No matter what kind of steel-hearted robot we serve or build,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/aaronallen.com\/blog\/thanksgiving-restaurant-leaders\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">human traits<\/a>\u00a0\u2014\u00a0gratitude, generosity, graciousness \u2014 will continue to be appreciated and in vogue.<\/p><p>We are equally responsible for helping contribute to a better way forward as anyone above or below us; anyone who came before us to inspire; or anyone who follows in our footprints and example.<\/p><p>Service is above us, not beneath us.
