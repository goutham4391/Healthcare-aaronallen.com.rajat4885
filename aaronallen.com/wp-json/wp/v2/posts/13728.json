Nearly every geography, cuisine, and operating model is being hit with increased costs relative to rent, labor, commodities, demands of modernization, competitive pricing and promotional tactics designed to take share, and a more fickle and demanding consumer with rapidly evolving dining behaviors.<\/p>\n<p>From Middle America to the <a href=\"https:\/\/aaronallen.com\/blog\/restaurant-margins-shrinking\">Middle East<\/a> and everywhere in-between, there is spotty revenue growth with unique brands and <a href=\"https:\/\/aaronallen.com\/blog\/alternative-foodservice-formats\">hybrid formats<\/a> that is coming at the cost of <a href=\"https:\/\/aaronallen.com\/blog\/casual-dining-restaurant-chains-entering-dangerous-waters\">lumbering incumbents<\/a> torn between two competing notions: drive revenue or cut costs.<\/p>\n<p>But the choice doesn\u2019t have to be binary. Both can be done simultaneously while catching a wider net of performance improvements \u2014 banded together through a single improvement initiative \u2014 &nbsp;that can also prove powerful as a catalyst for wider organizational and financial transformation.<\/p>\n<p>As we\u2019ve said before, the menu is the single most important piece of marketing collateral that a restaurant has, and every great restaurant turnaround worked its way from the inside out \u2014 originating from the heart of the house, expressed through brand purpose and positioning, and manifesting itself through the menu and other vital stakeholder touchpoints.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you\u2019ve embarked on a <a href=\"https:\/\/aaronallen.com\/blog\/restaurant-brand-audit\">brand audit<\/a>, a <a href=\"https:\/\/aaronallen.com\/blog\/restaurant-brand-refresh\">brand refresh<\/a>, or a full-on turnaround, revitalizing a restaurant\u2019s menu is one of the most complex \u2014 yet surest and fastest \u2014 ways to improve profitability.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Here&#8217;s How Menu Engineering Can Help&nbsp;<\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Revenue Growth<\/strong> \u2013 A 2% increase in sales is equivalent to a 10% reduction in cost. A well-engineered menu can drive check average, new trials, frequency, party size, and advocacy by identifying opportunities for upsells and add-ons, new profit centers, limited time offers (LTOs), bounce backs, and new products.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Food and Beverage Costs<\/strong> \u2013 There are a number of <a href=\"https:\/\/aaronallen.com\/blog\/launching-a-new-menu\">questions to be asked<\/a> when identifying <a href=\"https:\/\/aaronallen.com\/blog\/how-to-reduce-restaurant-food-cost\">ways to improve food costs<\/a>. To be sure though, they can\u2019t be improved sustainably by simply increasing prices across the board, reducing portion sizes, and swapping out ingredients for lower-priced (and lesser-quality) alternatives. Menus can and should function like a tour guide to help navigate guests to items that are not just more profitable, but also that are <a href=\"https:\/\/aaronallen.com\/blog\/how-to-market-a-restaurant#6\">signature items<\/a> (the Cayman Curse is our most straightforward and time-tested <a href=\"https:\/\/aaronallen.com\/blog\/how-to-market-a-restaurant#6\">example<\/a>) that can enhance brand positioning and perception while also supporting margin growth.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Labor<\/strong> \u2013 With the menu making an impact across all functional areas of the business, it can influence make\/buy decisions, inform discussions about insourcing or outsourcing a commissary kitchen, and &#8211; properly approached &#8211; a menu overhaul can certainly be an effective lever for wider&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/aaronallen.com\/blog\/restaurant-labor-optimization-strategies\" rel=\"noopener\">labor optimization<\/a>&nbsp;efforts. When you get into the nuts and bolts of margin improvement through the lens of a holistic menu strategy, you will undoubtedly find ways to optimize labor (best done by balancing the guest experience, operational process improvements, and utilization metrics).<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Marketing<\/strong> \u2013 When done well, menus help garner free publicity, gain priceless&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/aaronallen.com\/blog\/earned-media-restaurant-high-valuation\" rel=\"noopener\">earned media<\/a>,&nbsp;and give something to talk about internally and externally in such a way that can seriously drive revenues and advocacy. These kinds of initiatives give a good reason for external messaging, versus marketing simply for the sake of marketing. An understanding of behavioral economics and both pricing and&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/aaronallen.com\/blog\/the-psychology-of-menu-design\" rel=\"noopener\">menu psychology<\/a>&nbsp;are becoming requisites of the modern foodservice marketer.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong>Market Share<\/strong> \u2013 Think of any of the most successful restaurant turnarounds in recent history and you will find a commonality; those who have been gaining share at their competitors\u2019 expense leveraged the menu as a central part of their strategy. Right? Can you think of any examples worth mentioning that this wasn\u2019t the case? Market share gains are not just about effective marketing or a lucky card draw. The category leaders thrust themselves forward with a well-choreographed and charismatic campaign that was either centered on the menu or considered it central to their efforts. They weren\u2019t handed gains, they won them with their menu engineering strategy emblazoned on the shield and sword they fought with.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><strong>Enterprise Value<\/strong> \u2013 Everyone wants to be associated with a winner, and meaningful menu improvements can help create the momentum to grow sales, margins, and win the hearts and minds of those who matter most (inside and outside the business). When you get the menu right, you will enjoy benefits not only to the P&amp;L but also on the balance sheet. Transformations born out of the heart-of-the-house (brand positioning, product development, enrolling stakeholders, etc.) clearly equate to top-quartile performance with regard to other <a href=\"https:\/\/aaronallen.com\/restaurant-finance\">fundamentals of finance<\/a> \u2014 like the balance sheet. Those getting it right with their menu strategy are also rewarded with growth of intangibles and intrinsic value of the enterprise they are entrusted with enhancing.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Because of the nature of the incrementalism and organizational inertia that can sometimes be hard to beat, menus are often developed based on the momentum of what was there before (that and more&nbsp;<a style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\" href=\"https:\/\/aaronallen.com\/blog\/restaurant-menu-design-mistakes\">common menu mistakes to avoid<\/a>&nbsp;here).&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Many organizations tout the&nbsp;<a style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\" href=\"https:\/\/aaronallen.com\/blog\/restaurant-industry-innovation\" rel=\"noopener\">virtues of innovation<\/a>&nbsp;while also lacking the internal will or systems required to create and implement change on a holistic and seismic level. That also means, usually those who are responsible for the rollout of the menu are either trapped in a committee consensus environment, lack the organizational influence, or are wary of risking internal political capital to shake things up in a meaningful way.<\/p>\n<h2>Menu Engineering Across Functional Areas<\/h2>\n<p>Since nearly every functional area is touched by the menu (supply chain, marketing, operations, training, culinary and beverage development teams, finance) and will require&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/aaronallen.com\/blog\/technology-in-restaurants\" rel=\"noopener\">buy-in and winning over critical stakeholders<\/a> (support center team, field- and unit-level operations, external supply and distribution partners, franchisees, financiers, crew-level teams, media, and most especially the guest), it serves as a central point of senior-level influence.<\/p>\n<p>While many view the menu like maintenance \u2014 something that needs touch-up paint and an oil change \u2014 influential category leaders have leveraged menu engineering as a means to stage a turnaround and reinvigorate a system.<\/p>\n<p>The tools and techniques can be as black and white as the ebony and ivory of a piano but remain as elusive as the perfect symphony or composition when left to less-skilled hands. The music here requires both stylistic artistry and technical mastery. It\u2019s deceptively simple; getting the right chords, rhythm, harmony, balance, and a beat that both soothes the soul and exudes the shared spirit and enthusiasm (a brand, company, product, community, shareholders, stakeholders, and the rest of it). When you get those things just right, though, you can not only improve sales and margins, you can bring something into the world that inspires others and stands the test of time.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-d6c9b83 elementor-cta--skin-classic elementor-animated-content elementor-bg-transform elementor-bg-transform-zoom-in elementor-widget elementor-widget-call-to-action\" data-id=\"d6c9b83\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"call-to-action.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https:\/\/aaronallen.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/elementor\/css\/custom-pro-widget-call-to-action.min.css?ver=1661809300\">\t\t<a class=\"elementor-cta\" href=\"https:\/\/aaronallen.com\/contact\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"elementor-cta__title elementor-cta__content-item elementor-content-item\">What Would You Like To Make Better?<\/h2>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-9c91dcb elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"9c91dcb\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<h3>About Aaron Allen &amp; Associates<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/aaronallen.com\/about-us\">Aaron Allen &amp; Associates<\/a>\u00a0works alongside senior executives of the world\u2019s leading foodservice and hospitality companies to help identify, size, and seize opportunities to drive growth, optimize performance, and enhance enterprise value.
