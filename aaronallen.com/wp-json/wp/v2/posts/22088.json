When you think about it that way, you can see why we realized long ago that there are actually more \u201cconsultants\u201d than there are restaurants (little wonder why our \u201ccompetitors\u201d have come and gone so fast in our space).<\/p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-22089 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/aaronallen.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Total-Addressable-Market-for-Restaurants-1024x737.jpg\" alt=\"Sunburst chart global food ecosystem\" width=\"640\" height=\"461\" srcset=\"https:\/\/11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Total-Addressable-Market-for-Restaurants-1024x737.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Total-Addressable-Market-for-Restaurants-300x216.jpg 300w, https:\/\/11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Total-Addressable-Market-for-Restaurants-768x553.jpg 768w, https:\/\/11qkih2fw9d2h2oz31jff0fi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Total-Addressable-Market-for-Restaurants.jpg 1212w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/p><p>Total Addressable Market is coming up a lot more frequently these days for our tech-oriented clients and their investors who are struggling to understand the difference between the total \u201c<strong><em>addressable<\/em><\/strong>\u201d market and the total market \u201c<strong><em>addressed<\/em><\/strong>\u201d \u2014 the difference between what is possible and what is plausible.<\/p><h2>What to Consider When Calculating the Total Addressable Market<\/h2><p><strong>Ultimately, it\u2019s about determining how well a company has thought through<\/strong>:<\/p><ul><li>What\u2019s the problem you are solving?<\/li><li>Who has this problem?

Is competition intensifying or easing?<\/li><li>How likely is it that margins will be compressed or erode over time?<\/li><\/ul><p>It\u2019s easy and obvious, right?<\/p><p>Not really.<\/p><p><strong><i>Every company eventually struggles with these questions.\u00a0<\/i><\/strong><\/p><p>As you work through these rather straightforward questions you heard first in your high school economics class, you begin to realize how important it is to review the list and refine answers and strategies over time as conditions change and evolve \u2014 especially when such an enormous global industry has been turned on its head and is looking for a better way forward across every category, geography, ownership type, and functional area of the business.<\/p><p>For instance, we realized (while our founder grew up in a family-owned restaurant as a third-generation restaurateur and we love mom and pop businesses) we\u2019re not able to profitably address the challenges small operators have with our holistic approach. That\u2019s why we give the ideas away for free for this audience via our\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/aaronallen.com\/newsletter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">newsletter<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/aaronallen.com\/blog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blog<\/a>, and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/aarondallen\/detail\/recent-activity\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">social media channels<\/a>.<\/p><h2>TAM Applications: The Example of POS Companies<\/h2><p><strong>Another recent example can be found looking at restaurant point-of-sale (POS) companies.<\/strong><\/p><p>Toast POS recently realized they couldn\u2019t profitably address large enterprise accounts and that trying to do so was such a drag on their business they had to lay off roughly 1,600 employees just before their IPO \u2013 representing nearly their entire enterprise sales division (which they\u2019re now trying to rebuild and find new competitive footing to help them gain traction they couldn\u2019t find before).\u00a0<\/p><p>Nearly every POS company has called us at some point (their investors too). When you look at the evolving landscape in just this one category of the B2B ecosystem in the industry you will find a fascinating example of an industry category self-organizing. Some have decided to differentiate with new combinations and channel communication strategies. Some levers and dials they use to hone in on \u201cwhere to play\u201d and \u201chow to win\u201d when they look for their own unique formula and combination of\u2026<\/p><ul><li>Features<\/li><li>Pricing (Structures, Models, High\/Low, Upselling, etc.)<\/li><li>Positioning (and advanced Counter-Positioning)<\/li><li>Channel \/ Category Strategy (Segmentation Strategies)<\/li><li>Marketing Channels\/ Mix<\/li><li>R&amp;D \/ Development Roadmap<\/li><li>Geographical Focus<\/li><li>Partnerships (JV and Reseller Strategies)<\/li><li>Buying Share and Capabilities (M&amp;A Strategies)<\/li><\/ul><p>The more sophisticated the organization, the more tools and resources they have to design strategies and win share. And the bigger they are, the more likely they are to augment their own internal insights and capabilities with the objectivity and outside their four walls experience capable advisory firms can deliver. We learned that\u2019s more where we should play as well \u2014 companies that need breadth and depth of technical and multi-national industry experience (making it easier for us to find each other to connect on inspiring and profitable ambitions together).<\/p><h2>The Power of Differentiation when Calculating the Total Addressable Market<\/h2><p><strong>If you ever want proof of the power of differentiation, take a stroll down the toilet paper aisle at your local grocery store.<\/strong><\/p><p>As you know, shelf space in competitive retail environments is expensive to come by. So why is it then grocery stores will dedicate up to half a full aisle just to toilet paper?<\/p><p><strong>Differentiation Wins a Place in Minds, On Shelves, and in Wallets<\/strong><\/p><p>Some clever paper company would have come in to explain how some people want the best and will pay for double-ply toilet paper. Someone else says women prefer pink, and so their colored toilet paper wins a spot. Yet another says they\u2019re the only ones with aloe vera-infused toilet paper (and the associated benefits, justifying their shelf space). And then there\u2019s always the offering for the budget conscience, and so something barely better than leaves and tree bark wins their spot as the low-cost leader.\u00a0<\/p><h2>What Does the TAM Mean for You?<\/h2><p>We wanted to take this opportunity to remind you Q3 is the best time of year to revisit questions like these so you still have time to get your most important initiatives funded in Q4 so that you\u2019re leapfrogging the competition (and\/or preventing being leapfrogged) in 2023<\/p><ol><li>Leverage the latest industry intelligence to triangulate your position and performance<ol><li>What is our global TAM?<\/li><li>Are there any use cases we are not leveraging?<\/li><li>How do we identify new opportunities and size them?<\/li><\/ol><\/li><li>Refine your findings to an actionable plan<ol><li>How do we drive revenue in a way that works over the short- and long-term?<\/li><li>How do we build brand-centric strategies?<\/li><li>How do we modernize and move to adjacent markets to amplify the TAM?<\/li><\/ol><\/li><li>Build the Business Case<\/li><li>Define the Technical Specifications (Plus Parameters and Guard Rails)<\/li><li>Enlist Multi-Disciplined Teams to Make Unique Contributions<\/li><li>Keep Shareholders and Stakeholders Informed and Engaged (Share the Limelight)<\/li><li>Apply Principles of Iterative Refinement; Focus on MVP (Minimum Viable Product)<\/li><li>Design, Develop, Deploy, Debrief \u2013 Work with Smart Stage-Gate System(s)<\/li><li>Add to the Corporate Consciousness and Knowledge Centers: Archives &amp; Lessons<\/li><li>Celebrate Successes and Failures (Both Are Valuable When Done Right)<\/li><\/ol><p>In other words, <strong>to effectively get your \u201ctoilet paper\u201d some shelf space in the company\u2019s 2023 budget<\/strong>, you\u2019ll need to apply the questions and approaches touched on here in a variety of ways and by combining results that connect multiple stakeholders and other factors that must be aligned simultaneously:<\/p><ol><li>Current customers\/clients \u2013 how to move to advocacy (frequency, check average, etc.)<\/li><li>Prospective customers\/clients \u2013 how to find, attract, convince, convert, retain<\/li><li>Alignment with company ambitions and wherewithal<\/li><li>Internal buy-in and approvals (effectively how to win friends and influence people)<\/li><li>Competitive blind spots, deficiencies, shortcomings (which battles and battlegrounds)<\/li><\/ol><p>If it feels overwhelming, that\u2019s because it often is.

For example, for a restaurant chain in the U.S. the TAM would be around $900 billion, which is the annual expenditure in food away from home.<\/p><h3>Serviceable Available Market (SAM)<\/h3><p>The Serviceable Available Market is a subset of the TAM. It\u2019s narrowed down to a company-specific category or segment.
