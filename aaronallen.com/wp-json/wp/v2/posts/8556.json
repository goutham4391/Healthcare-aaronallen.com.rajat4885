Today&#8217;s tech-savvy consumers expect their smartphone provider to come up with a new technology every twelve months.\u00a0 Restaurant industry executives who don&#8217;t think the same expectation for speeding up innovation doesn&#8217;t apply to their businesses are wrong. Both the tech and restaurant industries share the same consumer, so it\u2019s time the restaurant industry started getting used to the idea of continuous innovation.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few general tips relevant to any company considering a rebrand \u2014 but,\u00a0like a custom set of replacement dentures, it really should be custom-fit to work best.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Embrace Change Willingly<\/h2>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t matter how big or small your company is, it is scary to do a brand reboot if you are doing it right.\u00a0 If you\u2019ve been there since the early days\u2014or have a lot of your own money on the line\u2014you must be pushed beyond your comfort zone.\u00a0 Change willingly.\u00a0 If you wait until a brand rejuvenation project is obviously needed, it\u2019s too late. Ask yourself: When is the last time my business did a brand review? Remodel?<\/p>\n<h2>2. Work from the Inside Out<\/h2>\n<p>When you analyze it, you\u2019ll see that nearly every successful restaurant brand turnaround started in the heart of the house: in the kitchen, with the menu.\u00a0 Ill-conceived restaurant re-branding strategies start from the outside and work their way in; meaning they announce changes with expensive advertising campaigns, start with new <span data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;HDPE signage&quot;}\" data-sheets-userformat=\"{&quot;2&quot;:4226,&quot;4&quot;:[null,2,12040119],&quot;10&quot;:2,&quot;15&quot;:&quot;Arial&quot;}\">signage <\/span>and exterior remodels, and then they work their way in with interior remodels and after-the-fact staff training.\u00a0 Win the hearts and minds of the internal customer (the crew\/associates) and come up with killer new <a title=\"Chapter 6: Boosting Revenue with Signature Items\" href=\"https:\/\/aaronallen.com\/blog\/how-to-market-a-restaurant#6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">signature items<\/a> your associates believe in and rave about.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Consider the Six Senses<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sight<\/strong>: Does it look fresh? I mean in terms of actual fresh product but also in terms of other visuals like the paint, fixtures, finishes, fabrics, surfaces, uniforms, fonts, fashions, and overall vibe)?\u00a0 Go in through the front door instead of the back door; experience the brand as a new customer would and assess the gaps between what\u2019s there and what should or could be there.\u00a0 Sometimes just a fresh coat of paint can do wonders for perceptions of associates and guests.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Smell<\/strong>:\u00a0Put on a blindfold and have someone walk you around zone by zone of your restaurant.\u00a0 What do you smell?\u00a0 Think about it as you go through every zone and ask yourself \u2013 should there be a smell, and if so, what should it be and what is it now?\u00a0 Hint: It should not be the same smell in every zone and at every sequence of the dining experience.\u00a0 The sense of smell is the most memorable of all of the senses.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Sound:<\/strong>\u00a0 Now go through each zone guided only by your sense of sound.\u00a0 What should a guest hear (and not hear) in the dining room?\u00a0 In the restroom?\u00a0 At that booth near the kitchen?\u00a0 There are entire companies specialized purely in acoustical design because it\u2019s that important.\u00a0 Some chefs even consider the sense of sound in the creation of new dishes, meaning, not just how the dish looks and tastes but how does it <em>sound<\/em> as it is being eaten?<\/li>\n<li><strong>Touch:<\/strong>\u00a0 Do your doorknobs help tell your brand story?\u00a0 I know this may seem a little far-fetched for some, but even way back in the 1970\u2019s\u2014before \u2018brand story\u2019 was even a thing\u2014my dad thought this through in designing his rustic seafood restaurant.\u00a0 He wrapped the door handles in worn rope and used authentic and antique nautical equipment to help guests feel transported even before they stepped foot in the restaurant.\u00a0 Such queues add up to create an experience and set the stage for your brand to shine.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Taste:<\/strong>\u00a0 Naturally it\u2019s expected that the food and beverage offerings should taste amazing\u2014and most restaurant executives will claim theirs does.\u00a0 And I will assume you\u2019re already doing guest satisfaction surveys.\u00a0 But what about your associates?\u00a0 Would they recommend their employer as a place to eat?\u00a0 It\u2019s so important to get this right.\u00a0 (See <a title=\"Associate Engagement\" href=\"https:\/\/aaronallen.com\/blog\/associate-engagement-cost-of-pissed-off-employees-quantified\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Associate Engagement<\/a>.)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Sixth Sense:<\/strong>\u00a0 Great restaurants have some extra quality to them that you can\u2019t quite point to.\u00a0 All of the fundamentals are there \u2013 and those are great \u2013 but there\u2019s something extra that feels a little magical. If you ask me, great restaurants have a soul.\u00a0 It\u2019s something that can\u2019t be engineered, but the environment for it to exist can be designed.\u00a0 And you can aspire for this quality.\u00a0 Be original and build in the magic for your concept.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>4. Know the Trends<\/h2>\n<p>Before you spend the first dollar planning or implementing, make sure you\u2019ve spent at least a nickel researching and analyzing.\u00a0 Sure, you need to know your internal trends like you know the back of your hand.\u00a0 But you also are going to need to own up to the fact that there is more happening in the world than you alone can master.\u00a0 Make new friends and travel with them.\u00a0 Bring in an outside perspective.\u00a0 To start, see these <a title=\"Chapter 9: Boosting Restaurant Revenue by Being Remarkable\" href=\"https:\/\/aaronallen.com\/restaurant-trends\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">restaurant trends<\/a>.\u00a0 You should definitely benchmark and look at what others are doing, but if you mimic another brand yours can only ever be a counterfeit.<\/p>\n<h2>5. Focus Your Resources<\/h2>\n<p>Not even Coca Cola with a seemingly limitless budget can afford to do everything it wants to do at the same time.\u00a0 When you do a full top-to-bottom brand review and look to budget out for a reboot, you will inevitably exceed the parameters of what it makes sense to do simultaneously.\u00a0 This is a natural part of the process so don\u2019t feel discouraged.\u00a0 Embrace limitations as a source of inspiration to be more creative. Start with the basics.\u00a0 For instance, how current are your brand standards documents?\u00a0 You know, things like a professionally crafted positioning strategy, brand personality statement, set of measurable brand promises, and a compelling brand story.\u00a0 Plan and articulate first.<\/p>\n<h2>6. Get a New Dress<\/h2>\n<p>Oftentimes, car companies will put a new skin on a proven and renowned chassis.\u00a0 Maybe your underlying framework and chassis is solid and it\u2019s only your headlights and bodywork that\u2019s out of touch.\u00a0 Car companies can&#8217;t keep getting top dollar and industry accolades if they put the exact same model car out every single year.\u00a0 Are you retooling your menu and marketing every 6\u201312 months?\u00a0 Sure, it costs you too if you have to re-evaluate your menu a couple times per year and repackage, but wouldn\u2019t you agree those boring car companies have it so much worse?<\/p>\n<h2>7. Be Brave, Not Boring.<\/h2>\n<p>It fascinates me how many companies say in the same sentence, \u201cWe\u2019re looking for innovative ideas,\u201d but also \u201cwe need some case studies to get the support of the board.\u201d\u00a0 If it\u2019s truly innovative, you won\u2019t find a case study for it because it hasn\u2019t been done before.\u00a0 And if you can find a case study for it, it\u2019s not a novel idea and can only, at best, be a commandeering of someone else\u2019s innovation.\u00a0 A good rule of thumb here is to ask, \u201cWill what we\u2019re doing be considered so unique, exciting and ground-breaking that journalists from around the country (or world) will write about it?\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>8. Sometimes It&#8217;s Better to Start Over<\/h2>\n<p>In some cases, it\u2019s better to just get a fresh start than to keep trying to repair a brand that\u2019s built on a compromised foundation.\u00a0 Don\u2019t be afraid to change your name or start a new company\/brand.\u00a0 Sometimes you&#8217;re better off cleaning the slate and doing something fresh that was unrestrained by the previous brand parameters.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re not asking you to depart from your current \u2018brand\u2019 with reckless disregard; nor are we pushing you to hire a consultant \u2014 or to not trust your gut. I want you to find the courage and inspiration to do something so special and unique that you attract not just guests but associates, investors, and journalists.\u00a0 If you feel a little lost or overwhelmed, it\u2019s okay.\u00a0 It should feel that way if you\u2019re doing it right.\u00a0 Go it alone or hire experienced help.\u00a0 Companies like mine do this for a living, but you don\u2019t have to hire help.\u00a0 What you have to do above all else is aspire to do something meaningful and be willing to put it all on the line to bring it into the world.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Restaurant brands need to be refreshed every few years or they start to grow mold like expired bread.
